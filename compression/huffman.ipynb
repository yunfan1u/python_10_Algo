      "He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty-four\n",
      "days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him. But after forty days\n",
      "without a fish the boy’s parents had told him that the old man was now definitely and finally salao,\n",
      "which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone at their orders in another boat which\n",
      "caught three good fish the first week. It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with\n",
      "his skiff empty and he always went down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and\n",
      "harpoon and the sail that was furled around the mast. The sail was patched with flour sacks and,\n",
      "furled, it looked like the flag of permanent defeat.\n",
      "The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck. The brown\n",
      "blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its [9] reflection on the tropic sea were\n",
      "on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased\n",
      "scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. But none of these scars were fresh. They were as old as\n",
      "erosions in a fishless desert.\n",
      "Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the sea and were\n",
      "cheerful and undefeated.\n",
      "“Santiago,” the boy said to him as they climbed the bank from where the skiff was hauled up. “I\n",
      "could go with you again. We’ve made some money.”\n",
      "The old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him.\n",
      "“No,” the old man said. “You’re with a lucky boat. Stay with them.”\n",
      "“But remember how you went eighty-seven days without fish and then we caught big ones\n",
      "every day for three weeks.”\n",

      "“Why not?” the old man said. “Between fishermen.”\n",
      "They sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the old man and he was not\n",

      "2\n",
      "staggering at the end of each plank, to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck to carry\n",
      "them to the market in Havana. Those who had caught sharks had taken them to the shark factory on\n",
      "the other side of the cove where they were hoisted on a block and tackle, their livers removed, their\n",
      "fins cut off and their hides skinned out and their flesh cut into strips for salting.\n",
      "When the wind was in the east a smell came across the harbour from the shark factory; but\n",
      "today there [11] was only the faint edge of the odour because the wind had backed into the north\n",
      "and then dropped off and it was pleasant and sunny on the Terrace.\n",
      "“Santiago,” the boy said.\n",
      "“Yes,” the old man said. He was holding his glass and thinking of many years ago.\n",
      "“Can I go out to get sardines for you for tomorrow?”\n",
      "“No. Go and play baseball. I can still row and Rogelio will throw the net.”\n",

      "boat to pieces. Can you remember?”\n",
      "“I can remember the tail slapping and banging and the thwart breaking and the noise of the\n",

      "blood smell all over me.”\n",
      "[12] “Can you really remember that or did I just tell it to you?”\n",
      "“I remember everything from when we first went together.”\n",
      "The old man looked at him with his sun-burned, confident loving eyes.\n",
      "“If you were my boy I’d take you out and gamble,” he said. “But you are your father’s and your\n",
      "mother’s and you are in a lucky boat.”\n",
      "“May I get the sardines? I know where I can get four baits too.”\n",
      "“I have mine left from today. I put them in salt in the box.”\n",
      "“Let me get four fresh ones.”\n",
      "“One,” the old man said. His hope and his confidence had never gone. But now they were\n",
      "freshening as when the breeze rises.\n",
      "“Two,” the boy said.\n",
      "“Two,” the old man agreed. “You didn’t steal them?”\n",
      "“I would,” the boy said. “But I bought these.”\n",
      "“Thank you,” the old man said. He was too simple to wonder when he had attained humility.\n",
      "But he [13] knew he had attained it and he knew it was not disgraceful and it carried no loss of true\n",

      "come to your aid.”\n",
      "“He does not like to work too far out.”\n",
      "“No,” the boy said. “But I will see something that he cannot see such as a bird working and get\n",

      "“Are his eyes that bad?”\n",
      "“He is almost blind.”\n",
      "“It is strange,” the old man said. “He never went turtle-ing. That is what kills the eyes.”\n",

      "Ernest Hemingway ?? The Old Man and the Sea\n",

      "[14] “Let us take the stuff home,” the boy said. “So I can get the cast net and go after the\n",

      "They picked up the gear from the boat. The old man carried the mast on his shoulder and the\n",
      "boy carried the wooden boat with the coiled, hard-braided brown lines, the gaff and the harpoon\n",
      "with its shaft. The box with the baits was under the stern of the skiff along with the club that was\n",
      "used to subdue the big fish when they were brought alongside. No one would steal from the old\n",
      "man but it was better to take the sail and the heavy lines home as the dew was bad for them and,\n",
      "though he was quite sure no local people would steal from him, the old man thought that a gaff and\n",
      "a harpoon were needless temptations to leave in a boat.\n",
      "They walked up the road together to the old man’s shack and went in through its open door.\n",
      "The old man leaned the mast with its wrapped sail against the wall and the boy put the box and the\n",
      "other gear beside it. The mast was nearly as long as the one room of the shack. The shack was made\n",
      "of the tough budshields of the royal palm which are called guano and in it there was a bed, a table,\n",
      "one chair, and a place on the dirt floor to cook with charcoal. On the brown walls of the flattened,\n",
      "overlapping leaves of the sturdy fibered [15] guano there was a picture in color of the Sacred Heart\n",
      "of Jesus and another of the Virgin of Cobre. These were relics of his wife. Once there had been a\n",
      "tinted photograph of his wife on the wall but he had taken it down because it made him too lonely\n",
      "to see it and it was on the shelf in the corner under his clean shirt.\n",
      "“What do you have to eat?” the boy asked.\n",
      "“A pot of yellow rice with fish. Do you want some?”\n",
      "“No. I will eat at home. Do you want me to make the fire?”\n",
      "“No. I will make it later on. Or I may eat the rice cold.”\n",
      "“May I take the cast net?”\n",
      "“Of course.”\n",
      "There was no cast net and the boy remembered when they had sold it. But they went through\n",
      "this fiction every day. There was no pot of yellow rice and fish and the boy knew this too.\n",
      "“Eighty-five is a lucky number,” the old man said. “How would you like to see me bring one in\n",
      "that dressed out over a thousand pounds?”\n",
      "“I’ll get the cast net and go for sardines. Will you sit in the sun in the doorway?”\n",
      "[16] “Yes. I have yesterday’s paper and I will read the baseball.”\n",
      "The boy did not know whether yesterday’s paper was a fiction too. But the old man brought it\n",
      "out from under the bed.\n",
      "“Perico gave it to me at the bodega,” he explained. “I’ll be back when I have the sardines. I’ll\n",
      "keep yours and mine together on ice and we can share them in the morning. When I come back you\n",
      "can tell me about the baseball.”\n",
      "“The Yankees cannot lose.”\n",
      "“But I fear the Indians of Cleveland.”\n",
      "“Have faith in the Yankees my son. Think of the great DiMaggio.”\n",
      "“I fear both the Tigers of Detroit and the Indians of Cleveland.”\n",
      "“Be careful or you will fear even the Reds of Cincinnati and the White Sax of Chicago.”\n",
      "“You study it and tell me when I come back.”\n",
      "“Do you think we should buy a terminal of the lottery with an eighty-five? Tomorrow is the\n",
      "eighty-fifth day.”\n",
      "“We can do that,” the boy said. “But what about the eighty-seven of your great record?”\n",
      "[17] “It could not happen twice. Do you think you can find an eighty-five?”\n",
      "Ernest Hemingway ?? The Old Man and the Sea\n",
      "4\n",
      "“I can order one.\n",
      "“One sheet. That’s two dollars and a half. Who can we borrow that from?”\n",
      "“That’s easy. I can always borrow two dollars and a half.”\n",
      "“I think perhaps I can too. But I try not to borrow. First you borrow. Then you beg.”\n",
      "“Keep warm old man,” the boy said. “Remember we are in September.”\n",
      "“The month when the great fish come,” the old man said. “Anyone can be a fisherman in\n",
      "May.”\n",
      "“I go now for the sardines,” the boy said.\n",
      "When the boy came back the old man was asleep in the chair and the sun was down. The boy\n",
      "took the old army blanket off the bed and spread it over the back of the chair and over the old\n",
      "man’s shoulders. They were strange shoulders, still powerful although very old, and the neck was still\n",
      "strong too and the creases did not show so much when the old man was asleep and his head fallen\n",
      "forward. His shirt had been patched so many times that it was like the sail and the patches were\n",
      "faded to many different shades by the sun. The [18] old man’s head was very old though and with\n",

      "that the fishermen called the great well because there was a sudden deep of seven hundred fathoms\n",
      "where all sorts of fish congregated because of the swirl the current made against the steep walls of\n",
      "the floor of the ocean. Here there were concentrations of shrimp and bait fish and sometimes\n",

      "In the dark the old man could feel the morning coming and as he rowed he heard the trembling\n",
      "sound as flying fish left the water and the hissing that their stiff set wings made as they soared away\n",
      "in the darkness. He was very fond of flying fish as they were his principal friends on the ocean. He\n",
      "was sorry for the birds, especially the small delicate dark terns that were always flying and looking\n",
      "and almost never finding, and he thought, the birds have a harder life than we do except for the\n",
      "robber birds and the heavy strong ones. Why did they make birds so delicate and fine as those sea\n",
      "swallows when the ocean can be so cruel? She is kind and very beautiful. But she can be so cruel and\n",
      "it comes so suddenly and such birds that fly, dipping and hunting, with their small sad voices are\n",
      "made too delicately for the sea.\n",
      "He always thought of the sea as la mar which is what people call her in Spanish when they love\n",
      "her. Sometimes those who love her say bad things of her but they are always said as though she were\n",
      "a woman. Some of the younger fishermen, those who used buoys as floats for their lines and had\n",
      "motorboats, bought [29] when the shark livers had brought much money, spoke of her as el mar\n",
      "which is masculine. They spoke of her as a contestant or a place or even an enemy. But the old man\n",
      "always thought of her as feminine and as something that gave or withheld great favours, and if she\n",
      "did wild or wicked things it was because she could not help them. The moon affects her as it does a\n",
      "woman, he thought.\n",
      "He was rowing steadily and it was no effort for him since he kept well within his speed and the\n",

      "had hoped to be at this hour.\n",
      "I worked the deep wells for a week and did nothing, he thought. Today I’ll work out where the\n",
      "schools of bonito and albacore are and maybe there will be a big one with them.\n",
      "Before it was really light he had his baits out and was drifting with the current. One bait was\n",
      "down forty fathoms. The second was at seventy-five and the third and fourth were down in the blue\n",
      "Ernest Hemingway ?? The Old Man and the Sea\n",
      "8\n",
      "water at one [30] hundred and one hundred and twenty-five fathoms. Each bait hung head down\n",
      "with the shank of the hook inside the bait fish, tied and sewed solid and all the projecting part of the\n",
      "hook, the curve and the point, was covered with fresh sardines. Each sardine was hooked through\n",
      "both eyes so that they made a half-garland on the projecting steel. There was no part of the hook\n",
      "that a great fish could feel which was not sweet smelling and good tasting.\n",
      "The boy had given him two fresh small tunas, or albacores, which hung on the two deepest\n",
      "lines like plummets and, on the others, he had a big blue runner and a yellow jack that had been used\n",
      "before; but they were in good condition still and had the excellent sardines to give them scent and\n",
      "attractiveness. Each line, as thick around as a big pencil, was looped onto a green-sapped stick so\n",
      "that any pull or touch on the bait would make the stick dip and each line had two forty-fathom coils\n",
      "which could be made fast to the other spare coils so that, if it were necessary, a fish could take out\n",
      "over three hundred fathoms of line.\n",
      "Now the man watched the dip of the three sticks over the side of the skiff and rowed gently to\n",
      "keep the [31] lines straight up and down and at their proper depths. It was quite light and any\n",
      "moment now the sun would rise.\n",
      "The sun rose thinly from the sea and the old man could see the other boats, low on the water\n",
      "and well in toward the shore, spread out across the current. Then the sun was brighter and the glare\n",
      "came on the water and then, as it rose clear, the flat sea sent it back at his eyes so that it hurt sharply\n",
      "and he rowed without looking into it. He looked down into the water and watched the lines that\n",
      "went straight down into the dark of the water. He kept them straighter than anyone did, so that at\n",
      "each level in the darkness of the stream there would be a bait waiting exactly where he wished it to\n",
      "be for any fish that swam there. Others let them drift with the current and sometimes they were at\n",
      "sixty fathoms when the fishermen thought they were at a hundred.\n",
      "But, he thought, I keep them with precision. Only I have no luck any more. But who knows?\n",
      "Maybe today. Every day is a new day. It is better to be lucky. But I would rather be exact. Then\n",
      "when luck comes you are ready.\n",
      "The sun was two hours higher now and it did not [32] hurt his eyes so much to look into the\n",
      "east. There were only three boats in sight now and they showed very low and far inshore.\n",
      "All my life the early sun has hurt my eyes, he thought. Yet they are still good. In the evening I\n",
      "can look straight into it without getting the blackness. It has more force in the evening too. But in\n",
      "the morning it is painful.\n",
      "Just then he saw a man-of-war bird with his long black wings circling in the sky ahead of him.\n",
      "He made a quick drop, slanting down on his back-swept wings, and then circled again.\n",
      "“He’s got something,” the old man said aloud. “He’s not just looking.”\n",
      "He rowed slowly and steadily toward where the bird was circling. He did not hurry and he kept\n",
      "his lines straight up and down. But he crowded the current a little so that he was still fishing\n",
      "correctly though faster than he would have fished if he was not trying to use the bird.\n",
      "The bird went higher in the air and circled again, his wings motionless. Then he dove suddenly\n",
      "and the old man saw flying fish spurt out of the water and sail desperately over the surface.\n",
      "[33] “Dolphin,” the old man said aloud. “Big dolphin.”\n",
      "He shipped his oars and brought a small line from under the bow. It had a wire leader and a\n",
      "medium-sized hook and he baited it with one of the sardines. He let it go over the side and then\n",
      "made it fast to a ring bolt in the stern. Then he baited another line and left it coiled in the shade of\n",
      "the bow. He went back to rowing and to watching the long-winged black bird who was working,\n",
      "now, low over the water.\n",
      "As he watched the bird dipped again slanting his wings for the dive and then swinging them\n",
      "wildly and ineffectually as he followed the flying fish. The old man could see the slight bulge in the\n",

      "9\n",
      "through the water below the flight of the fish and would be in the water, driving at speed, when the\n",
      "fish dropped. It is a big school of dolphin, he thought. They are widespread and the flying fish have\n",
      "little chance. The bird has no chance. The flying fish are too big for him and they go too fast.\n",
      "He watched the flying fish burst out again and again and the ineffectual movements of the bird.\n",
      "That school has gotten away from me, he thought. They are moving out too fast and too far. But\n",
      "perhaps I will pick up [34] a stray and perhaps my big fish is around them. My big fish must be\n",
      "somewhere.\n",
      "The clouds over the land now rose like mountains and the coast was only a long green line with\n",
      "the gray blue hills behind it. The water was a dark blue now, so dark that it was almost purple. As he\n",
      "looked down into it he saw the red sifting of the plankton in the dark water and the strange light the\n",
      "sun made now. He watched his lines to see them go straight down out of sight into the water and he\n",
      "was happy to see so much plankton because it meant fish. The strange light the sun made in the\n",
      "water, now that the sun was higher, meant good weather and so did the shape of the clouds over the\n",
      "land. But the bird was almost out of sight now and nothing showed on the surface of the water but\n",
      "some patches of yellow, sun-bleached Sargasso weed and the purple, formalized, iridescent,\n",
      "gelatinous bladder of a Portuguese man-of-war floating dose beside the boat. It turned on its side\n",
      "and then righted itself. It floated cheerfully as a bubble with its long deadly purple filaments trailing\n",
      "a yard behind it in the water.\n",
      "“Agua mala,” the man said. “You whore.”\n",
      "From where he swung lightly against his oars he looked down into the water and saw the tiny\n",
      "fish that [35] were coloured like the trailing filaments and swam between them and under the small\n",
      "shade the bubble made as it drifted. They were immune to its poison. But men were not and when\n",
      "same of the filaments would catch on a line and rest there slimy and purple while the old man was\n",
      "working a fish, he would have welts and sores on his arms and hands of the sort that poison ivy or\n",
      "poison oak can give. But these poisonings from the agua mala came quickly and struck like a\n",
      "whiplash.\n",
      "The iridescent bubbles were beautiful. But they were the falsest thing in the sea and the old man\n",
      "loved to see the big sea turtles eating them. The turtles saw them, approached them from the front,\n",
      "then shut their eyes so they were completely carapaced and ate them filaments and all. The old man\n",
      "loved to see the turtles eat them and he loved to walk on them on the beach after a storm and hear\n",
      "them pop when he stepped on them with the horny soles of his feet.\n",
      "He loved green turtles and hawk-bills with their elegance and speed and their great value and he\n",
      "had a friendly contempt for the huge, stupid loggerheads, yellow in their armour-plating, strange in\n",
      "their [36] love-making, and happily eating the Portuguese men-of-war with their eyes shut.\n",
      "He had no mysticism about turtles although he had gone in turtle boats for many years. He was\n",
      "sorry for them all, even the great trunk backs that were as long as the skiff and weighed a ton. Most\n",
      "people are heartless about turtles because a turtle’s heart will beat for hours after he has been cut up\n",
      "and butchered. But the old man thought, I have such a heart too and my feet and hands are like\n",
      "theirs. He ate the white eggs to give himself strength. He ate them all through May to be strong in\n",
      "September and October for the truly big fish.\n",
      "He also drank a cup of shark liver oil each day from the big drum in the shack where many of\n",
      "the fishermen kept their gear. It was there for all fishermen who wanted it. Most fishermen hated\n",

      "“He’s found fish,” he said aloud. No flying fish broke the surface and there was no scattering of\n",

      "“The bird is a great help,” the old man said. Just then the stern line came taut under his foot,\n",
      "where he had kept a loop of the line, and he dropped his oars and felt tile weight of the small tuna’s\n",
      "shivering pull as he held the line firm and commenced to haul it in. The shivering increased as he\n",
      "pulled in and he could see the blue back of the fish in the water and the gold of his sides before he\n",
      "swung him over the side and into the boat. He lay in the stern in the sun, compact and bullet\n",
      "shaped, his big, unintelligent eyes staring as he thumped his life out against the planking of the boat\n",
      "with the quick shivering strokes of his neat, fast-moving [38] tail. The old man hit him on the head\n",
      "for kindness and kicked him, his body still shuddering, under the shade of the stern.\n",
      "“Albacore,” he said aloud. “He’ll make a beautiful bait. He’ll weigh ten pounds.”\n",
      "He did not remember when he had first started to talk aloud when he was by himself. He had\n",
      "sung when he was by himself in the old days and he had sung at night sometimes when he was alone\n",
      "steering on his watch in the smacks or in the turtle boats. He had probably started to talk aloud,\n",
      "when alone, when the boy had left. But he did not remember. When he and the boy fished together\n",
      "they usually spoke only when it was necessary. They talked at night or when they were storm-bound\n",
      "by bad weather. It was considered a virtue not to talk unnecessarily at sea and the old man had\n",
      "always considered it so and respected it. But now he said his thoughts aloud many times since there\n",
      "was no one that they could annoy.\n",
      "“If the others heard me talking out loud they would think that I am crazy,” he said aloud. “But\n",
      "since I am not crazy, I do not care. And the rich have radios to talk to them in their boats and to\n",
      "bring them the baseball.”\n",
      "[39] Now is no time to think of baseball, he thought. Now is the time to think of only one\n",
      "thing. That which I was born for. There might be a big one around that school, he thought. I picked\n",
      "up only a straggler from the albacore that were feeding. But they are working far out and fast.\n",
      "Everything that shows on the surface today travels very fast and to the north-east. Can that be the\n",
      "time of day? Or is it some sign of weather that I do not know?\n",
      "He could not see the green of the shore now but only the tops of the blue hills that showed\n",
      "white as though they were snow-capped and the clouds that looked like high snow mountains above\n",
      "them. The sea was very dark and the light made prisms in the water. The myriad flecks of the\n",
      "plankton were annulled now by the high sun and it was only the great deep prisms in the blue water\n",
      "that the old man saw now with his lines going straight down into the water that was a mile deep.\n",
      "The tuna, the fishermen called all the fish of that species tuna and only distinguished among\n",
      "them by their proper names when they came to sell them or to trade them for baits, were down\n",
      "again. The sun was [40] hot now and the old man felt it on the back of his neck and felt the sweat\n",
      "trickle down his back as he rowed.\n",
      "I could just drift, he thought, and sleep and put a bight of line around my toe to wake me. But\n",
      "today is eighty-five days and I should fish the day well.\n",
      "Just then, watching his lines, he saw one of the projecting green sticks dip sharply.\n",
      "“Yes,” he said. “Yes,” and shipped his oars without bumping the boat. He reached out for the\n",
      "line and held it softly between the thumb and forefinger of his right hand. He felt no strain nor\n",
      "weight and he held the line lightly. Then it came again. This time it was a tentative pull, not solid nor\n",
      "heavy, and he knew exactly what it was. One hundred fathoms down a marlin was eating the\n",
      "sardines that covered the point and the shank of the hook where the hand-forged hook projected\n",
      "from the head of the small tuna.\n",
      "Ernest Hemingway ?? The Old Man and the Sea\n",
      "11\n",
      "The old man held the line delicately, and softly, with his left hand, unleashed it from the stick.\n",
      "Now he could let it run through his fingers without the fish feeling any tension.\n",
      "This far out, he must be huge in this month, he thought. Eat them, fish. Eat them. Please eat\n",
      "them.\n",
      "[41] How fresh they are and you down there six hundred feet in that cold water in the dark.\n",
      "Make another turn in the dark and come back and eat them.\n",
      "He felt the light delicate pulling and then a harder pull when a sardine’s head must have been\n",
      "more difficult to break from the hook. Then there was nothing.\n",
      "“Come on,” the old man said aloud. “Make another turn. Just smell them. Aren’t they lovely?\n",
      "Eat them good now and then there is the tuna. Hard and cold and lovely. Don’t be shy, fish. Eat\n",
      "them.”\n",
      "He waited with the line between his thumb and his finger, watching it and the other lines at the\n",
      "same time for the fish might have swum up or down. Then came the same delicate pulling touch\n",
      "again.\n",
      "“He’ll take it,” the old man said aloud. “God help him to take it.”\n",
      "He did not take it though. He was gone and the old man felt nothing.\n",
      "“He can’t have gone,” he said. “Christ knows he can’t have gone. He’s making a turn. Maybe he\n",
      "has been hooked before and he remembers something of it.\n",
      "[42] Then he felt the gentle touch on the line and he was happy.\n",
      "“It was only his turn,” he said. “He’ll take it.”\n",
      "He was happy feeling the gentle pulling and then he felt something hard and unbelievably\n",
      "heavy. It was the weight of the fish and he let the line slip down, down, down, unrolling off the first\n",
      "of the two reserve coils. As it went down, slipping lightly through the old man’s fingers, he still\n",
      "could feel the great weight, though the pressure of his thumb and finger were almost imperceptible.\n",
      "“What a fish,” he said. “He has it sideways in his mouth now and he is moving off with it.”\n",
      "Then he will turn and swallow it, he thought. He did not say that because he knew that if you\n",
      "said a good thing it might not happen. He knew what a huge fish this was and he thought of him\n",
      "moving away in the darkness with the tuna held crosswise in his mouth. At that moment he felt him\n",
      "stop moving but the weight was still there. Then the weight increased and he gave more line. He\n",
      "tightened the pressure of his thumb and finger for a moment and the weight increased and was\n",
      "going straight down.\n",
      "[43] “He’s taken it,” he said. “Now I’ll let him eat it well.”\n",
      "He let the line slip through his fingers while he reached down with his left hand and made fast\n",
      "the free end of the two reserve coils to the loop of the two reserve coils of the next line. Now he\n",
      "was ready. He had three forty-fathom coils of line in reserve now, as well as the coil he was using.\n",
      "“Eat it a little more,” he said. “Eat it well.”\n",
      "Eat it so that the point of the hook goes into your heart and kills you, he thought. Come up\n",
      "easy and let me put the harpoon into you. All right. Are you ready? Have you been long enough at\n",
      "table?\n",
      "“Now!” he said aloud and struck hard with both hands, gained a yard of line and then struck\n",
      "again and again, swinging with each arm alternately on the cord with all the strength of his arms and\n",
      "the pivoted weight of his body.\n",
      "Nothing happened. The fish just moved away slowly and the old man could not raise him an\n",
      "inch. His line was strong and made for heavy fish and he held it against his hack until it was so taut\n",
      "that beads of water were jumping from it. Then it began to make a slow hissing sound in the water\n",
      "and he still held it, bracing [44] himself against the thwart and leaning back against the pull. The boat\n",
      "began to move slowly off toward the north-west.\n",
      "Ernest Hemingway ?? The Old Man and the Sea\n",
      "12\n",
      "The fish moved steadily and they travelled slowly on the calm water. The other baits were still\n",
      "in the water but there was nothing to be done.\n",
      "“I wish I had the boy” the old man said aloud. “I’m being towed by a fish and I’m the towing\n",
      "bitt. I could make the line fast. But then he could break it. I must hold him all I can and give him\n",
      "line when he must have it. Thank God he is travelling and not going down.”\n",
      "What I will do if he decides to go down, I don’t know. What I’ll do if he sounds and dies I\n",
      "don’t know. But I’ll do something. There are plenty of things I can do.\n",
      "He held the line against his back and watched its slant in the water and the skiff moving steadily\n",
      "to the north-west.\n",
      "This will kill him, the old man thought. He can’t do this forever. But four hours later the fish\n",
      "was still swimming steadily out to sea, towing the skiff, and the old man was still braced solidly with\n",
      "the line across his back.\n",
      "[45] “It was noon when I hooked him,” he said. “And I have never seen him.”\n",
      "He had pushed his straw hat hard down on his head before he hooked the fish and it was\n",
      "cutting his forehead. He was thirsty too and he got down on his knees and, being careful not to jerk\n",
      "on the line, moved as far into the bow as he could get and reached the water bottle with one hand.\n",
      "He opened it and drank a little. Then he rested against the bow. He rested sitting on the un-stepped\n",
      "mast and sail and tried not to think but only to endure.\n",
      "Then he looked behind him and saw that no land was visible. That makes no difference, he\n",
      "thought. I can always come in on the glow from Havana. There are two more hours before the sun\n",
      "sets and maybe he will come up before that. If he doesn’t maybe he will come up with the moon. If\n",
      "he does not do that maybe he will come up with the sunrise. I have no cramps and I feel strong. It is\n",
      "he that has the hook in his mouth. But what a fish to pull like that. He must have his mouth shut\n",
      "tight on the wire. I wish I could see him. I wish I could see him only once to know what I have\n",
      "against me.\n",
      "The fish never changed his course nor his direction [46] all that night as far as the man could\n",
      "tell from watching the stars. It was cold after the sun went down and the old man’s sweat dried cold\n",
      "on his back and his arms and his old legs. During the day he had taken the sack that covered the bait\n",
      "box and spread it in the sun to dry. After the sun went down he tied it around his neck so that it\n",
      "hung down over his back and he cautiously worked it down under the line that was across his\n",
      "shoulders now. The sack cushioned the line and he had found a way of leaning forward against the\n",
      "bow so that he was almost comfortable. The position actually was only somewhat less intolerable;\n",
      "but he thought of it as almost comfortable.\n",
      "I can do nothing with him and he can do nothing with me, he thought. Not as long as he keeps\n",
      "this up.\n",
      "Once he stood up and urinated over the side of the skiff and looked at the stars and checked his\n",
      "course. The line showed like a phosphorescent streak in the water straight out from his shoulders.\n",
      "They were moving more slowly now and the glow of Havana was not so strong, so that he knew the\n",
      "current must be carrying them to the eastward. If I lose the glare of Havana we must be going more\n",
      "to the eastward, he thought. For if the fish’s course held true I must see it for many more [47] hours.\n",
      "I wonder how the baseball came out in the grand leagues today, he thought. It would be wonderful\n",
      "to do this with a radio. Then he thought, think of it always. Think of what you are doing. You must\n",
      "do nothing stupid.\n",
      "Then he said aloud, “I wish I had the boy. To help me and to see this.”\n",
      "No one should be alone in their old age, he thought. But it is unavoidable. I must remember to\n",
      "eat the tuna before he spoils in order to keep strong. Remember, no matter how little you want to,\n",
      "that you must eat him in the morning. Remember, he said to himself.\n",

      "13\n",
      "During the night two porpoises came around the boat and he could hear them rolling and\n",
      "blowing. He could tell the difference between the blowing noise the male made and the sighing blow\n",
      "of the female.\n",
      "“They are good,” he said. “They play and make jokes and love one another. They are our\n",
      "brothers like the flying fish.”\n",
      "Then he began to pity the great fish that he had hooked. He is wonderful and strange and who\n",
      "knows how old he is, he thought. Never have I had such a strong fish nor one who acted so\n",
      "strangely. Perhaps he is too wise to jump. He could ruin me by jumping or [48] by a wild rush. But\n",
      "perhaps he has been hooked many times before and he knows that this is how he should make his\n",
      "fight. He cannot know that it is only one man against him, nor that it is an old man. But what a great\n",
      "fish he is and what will he bring in the market if the flesh is good. He took the bait like a male and\n",
      "he pulls like a male and his fight has no panic in it. I wonder if he has any plans or if he is just as\n",
      "desperate as I am?\n",
      "He remembered the time he had hooked one of a pair of marlin. The male fish always let the\n",
      "female fish feed first and the hooked fish, the female, made a wild, panic-stricken, despairing fight\n",
      "that soon exhausted her, and all the time the male had stayed with her, crossing the line and circling\n",
      "with her on the surface. He had stayed so close that the old man was afraid he would cut the line\n",
      "with his tail which was sharp as a scythe and almost of that size and shape. When the old man had\n",
      "gaffed her and clubbed her, holding the rapier bill with its sandpaper edge and dubbing her across\n",
      "the top of her head until her colour turned to a colour almost like the backing of mirrors, and then,\n",
      "with the boy’s aid, hoisted her aboard, the male fish had stayed by the side of the boat. Then, while\n",
      "the old man was clearing the lines and preparing the harpoon, [49] the male fish jumped high into\n",
      "the air beside the boat to see where the female was and then went down deep, his lavender wings,\n",
      "that were his pectoral fins, spread wide and all his wide lavender stripes showing. He was beautiful,\n",
      "the old man remembered, and he had stayed.\n",
      "That was the saddest thing I ever saw with them, the old man thought. The boy was sad too\n",
      "and we begged her pardon and butchered her promptly.\n",
      "“I wish the boy was here,” he said aloud and settled himself against the rounded planks of the\n",
      "bow and felt the strength of the great fish through the line he held across his shoulders moving\n",
      "steadily toward whatever he had chosen.\n",
      "When once, through my treachery, it had been necessary to him to make a choice, the old man\n",
      "thought.\n",
      "His choice had been to stay in the deep dark water far out beyond all snares and traps and\n",
      "treacheries. My choice was to go there to find him beyond all people. Beyond all people in the\n",
      "world. Now we are joined together and have been since noon. And no one to help either one of us.\n",
      "Perhaps I should not have been a fisherman, he thought. But that was the thing that I was born\n",
      "for. I must surely remember to eat the tuna after it gets light.\n",
      "[50] Some time before daylight something took one of the baits that were behind him. He heard\n",
      "the stick break and the line begin to rush out over the gunwale of the skiff. In the darkness he\n",
      "loosened his sheath knife and taking all the strain of the fish on his left shoulder he leaned back and\n",
      "cut the line against the wood of the gunwale. Then he cut the other line closest to him and in the\n",
      "dark made the loose ends of the reserve coils fast. He worked skillfully with the one hand and put\n",
      "his foot on the coils to hold them as he drew his knots tight. Now he had six reserve coils of line.\n",
      "There were two from each bait he had severed and the two from the bait the fish had taken and they\n",
      "were all connected.\n",
      "After it is light, he thought, I will work back to the forty-fathom bait and cut it away too and\n",
      "link up the reserve coils. I will have lost two hundred fathoms of good Catalan cardel and the hooks\n",
      "and leaders. That can be replaced. But who replaces this fish if I hook some fish and it cuts him off?\n",
      "Ernest Hemingway ?? The Old Man and the Sea\n",
      "14\n",
      "I don’t know what that fish was that took the bait just now. It could have been a marlin or a\n",
      "broadbill or a shark. I never felt him. I had to get rid of him too fast.\n",
      "Aloud he said, “I wish I had the boy.”\n",
      "[51] But you haven’t got the boy, he thought. You have only yourself and you had better work\n",
      "back to the last line now, in the dark or not in the dark, and cut it away and hook up the two reserve\n",
      "coils.\n",
      "So he did it. It was difficult in the dark and once the fish made a surge that pulled him down on\n",
      "his face and made a cut below his eye. The blood ran down his cheek a little way. But it coagulated\n",
      "and dried before it reached his chin and he worked his way back to the bow and rested against the\n",
      "wood. He adjusted the sack and carefully worked the line so that it came across a new part of his\n",
      "shoulders and, holding it anchored with his shoulders, he carefully felt the pull of the fish and then\n",
      "felt with his hand the progress of the skiff through the water.\n",
      "I wonder what he made that lurch for, he thought. The wire must have slipped on the great hill\n",
      "of his back. Certainly his back cannot feel as badly as mine does. But he cannot pull this skiff\n",
      "forever, no matter how great he is. Now everything is cleared away that might make trouble and I\n",
      "have a big reserve of line; all that a man can ask.\n",
      "“Fish,” he said softly, aloud, “I’ll stay with you until I am dead.”\n",
      "[52] He’ll stay with me too, I suppose, the old man thought and he waited for it to be light. It\n",
      "was cold now in the time before daylight and he pushed against the wood to be warm. I can do it as\n",
      "long as he can, he thought. And in the first light the line extended out and down into the water. The\n",
      "boat moved steadily and when the first edge of the sun rose it was on the old man’s right shoulder.\n",
      "“He’s headed north,” the old man said. The current will have set us far to the eastward, he\n",
      "thought. I wish he would turn with the current. That would show that he was tiring.\n",
      "When the sun had risen further the old man realized that the fish was not tiring. There was only\n",
      "one favorable sign. The slant of the line showed he was swimming at a lesser depth. That did not\n",
      "necessarily mean that he would jump. But he might.\n",
      "“God let him jump,” the old man said. “I have enough line to handle him.”\n",
      "Maybe if I can increase the tension just a little it will hurt him and he will jump, he thought.\n",
      "Now that it is daylight let him jump so that he’ll fill the sacks along his backbone with air and then\n",
      "he cannot go deep to die.\n",
      "[53] He tried to increase the tension, but the line had been taut up to the very edge of the\n",
      "breaking point since he had hooked the fish and he felt the harshness as he leaned back to pull and\n",
      "knew he could put no more strain on it. I must not jerk it ever, he thought. Each jerk widens the cut\n",
      "the hook makes and then when he does jump he might throw it. Anyway I feel better with the sun\n",
      "and for once I do not have to look into it.\n",
      "There was yellow weed on the line but the old man knew that only made an added drag and he\n",
      "was pleased. It was the yellow Gulf weed that had made so much phosphorescence in the night.\n",
      "“Fish,” he said, “I love you and respect you very much. But I will kill you dead before this day\n",
      "ends.”\n",
      "Let us hope so, he thought.\n",
      "A small bird came toward the skiff from the north. He was a warbler and flying very low over\n",
      "the water. The old man could see that he was very tired.\n",
      "The bird made the stern of the boat and rested there. Then he flew around the old man’s head\n",
      "and rested on the line where he was more comfortable.\n",
      "“How old are you?” the old man asked the bird. “Is this your first trip?”\n",
      "[54] The bird looked at him when he spoke. He was too tired even to examine the line and he\n",
      "teetered on it as his delicate feet gripped it fast.\n",
      "Ernest Hemingway ?? The Old Man and the Sea\n",
      "15\n",
      "“It’s steady,” the old man told him. “It’s too steady. You shouldn’t be that tired after a windless\n",
      "night. What are birds coming to?”\n",
      "The hawks, he thought, that come out to sea to meet them. But he said nothing of this to the\n",
      "bird who could not understand him anyway and who would learn about the hawks soon enough.\n",
      "“Take a good rest, small bird,” he said. “Then go in and take your chance like any man or bird\n",
      "or fish.”\n",
      "It encouraged him to talk because his back had stiffened in the night and it hurt truly now.\n",
      "“Stay at my house if you like, bird,” he said. “I am sorry I cannot hoist the sail and take you in\n",
      "with the small breeze that is rising. But I am with a friend.”\n",
      "Just then the fish gave a sudden lurch that pulled the old man down onto the bow and would\n",
      "have pulled him overboard if he had not braced himself and given some line.\n",
      "The bird had flown up when the line jerked and the old man had not even seen him go. He felt\n",
      "the line [55] carefully with his right hand and noticed his hand was bleeding.\n",
      "“Something hurt him then,” he said aloud and pulled back on the line to see if he could turn the\n",
      "fish. But when he was touching the breaking point he held steady and settled back against the strain\n",
      "of the line.\n",
      "“You’re feeling it now, fish,” he said. “And so, God knows, am I.”\n",
      "He looked around for the bird now because he would have liked him for company. The bird\n",
      "was gone.\n",
      "You did not stay long, the man thought. But it is rougher where you are going until you make\n",
      "the shore. How did I let the fish cut me with that one quick pull he made? I must be getting very\n",
      "stupid. Or perhaps I was looking at the small bird and thinking of him. Now I will pay attention to\n",
      "my work and then I must eat the tuna so that I will not have a failure of strength.\n",
      "“I wish the boy were here and that I had some salt,” he said aloud.\n",
      "Shifting the weight of the line to his left shoulder and kneeling carefully he washed his hand in\n",
      "the ocean and held it there, submerged, for more than a [56] minute watching the blood trail away\n",
      "and the steady movement of the water against his hand as the boat moved.\n",
      "“He has slowed much,” he said.\n",
      "The old man would have liked to keep his hand in the salt water longer but he was afraid of\n",
      "another sudden lurch by the fish and he stood up and braced himself and held his hand up against\n",
      "the sun. It was only a line burn that had cut his flesh. But it was in the working part of his hand. He\n",
      "knew he would need his hands before this was over and he did not like to be cut before it started.\n",
      "“Now,” he said, when his hand had dried, “I must eat the small tuna. I can reach him with the\n",

      "keeping it clear of the coiled lines. Holding the line with his left shoulder again, and bracing on his\n",
      "left hand and arm, he took the tuna off the gaff hook and put the gaff back in place. He put one\n",
      "knee on the fish and cut strips of dark red meat longitudinally from the back of the head to the tail.\n",
      "They were wedge-shaped strips and he cut [57] them from next to the back bone down to the edge\n",
      "of the belly. When he had cut six strips he spread them out on the wood of the bow, wiped his knife\n",
      "on his trousers, and lifted the carcass of the bonito by the tail and dropped it overboard.\n",
      "“I don’t think I can eat an entire one,” he said and drew his knife across one of the strips. He\n",
      "could feel the steady hard pull of the line and his left hand was cramped. It drew up tight on the\n",
      "heavy cord and he looked at it in disgust.\n",
      "“What kind of a hand is that,” he said. “Cramp then if you want. Make yourself into a claw. It\n",
      "will do you no good.”\n",

      "16\n",
      "Come on, he thought and looked down into the dark water at the slant of the line. Eat it now\n",
      "and it will strengthen the hand. It is not the hand’s fault and you have been many hours with the\n",
      "fish. But you can stay with him forever. Eat the bonito now.\n",
      "He picked up a piece and put it in his mouth and chewed it slowly. It was not unpleasant.\n",
      "Chew it well, he thought, and get all the juices. It would not be had to eat with a little lime or\n",
      "with lemon or with salt.\n",
      "“How do you feel, hand?” he asked the cramped [58] hand that was almost as stiff as rigor\n",
      "mortis. “I’ll eat some more for you.”\n",
      "He ate the other part of the piece that he had cut in two. He chewed it carefully and then spat\n",
      "out the skin.\n",
      "“How does it go, hand? Or is it too early to know?”\n",
      "He took another full piece and chewed it.\n",
      "“It is a strong full-blooded fish,” he thought. “I was lucky to get him instead of dolphin.\n",
      "Dolphin is too sweet. This is hardly sweet at all and all the strength is still in it.”\n",
      "There is no sense in being anything but practical though, he thought. I wish I had some salt.\n",
      "And I do not know whether the sun will rot or dry what is left, so I had better eat it all although I\n",
      "am not hungry. The fish is calm and steady. I will eat it all and then I will be ready.\n",
      "“Be patient, hand,” he said. “I do this for you.”\n",
      "I wish I could feed the fish, he thought. He is my brother. But I must kill him and keep strong\n",
      "to do it. Slowly and conscientiously he ate all of the wedge-shaped strips of fish.\n",
      "He straightened up, wiping his hand on his trousers. “Now,” he said. “You can let the cord go,\n",
      "hand, and I will handle him with the right arm alone until you [59] stop that nonsense.” He put his\n",
      "left foot on the heavy line that the left hand had held and lay back against the pull against his back.\n",
      "“God help me to have the cramp go,” he said. “Because I do not know what the fish is going to\n",
      "do.”\n",
      "But he seems calm, he thought, and following his plan. But what is his plan, he thought. And\n",
      "what is mine? Mine I must improvise to his because of his great size. If he will jump I can kill him.\n",
      "But he stays down forever. Then I will stay down with him forever.\n",
      "He rubbed the cramped hand against his trousers and tried to gentle the fingers. But it would\n",
      "not open. Maybe it will open with the sun, he thought. Maybe it will open when the strong raw tuna\n",
      "is digested. If I have to have it, I will open it, cost whatever it costs. But I do not want to open it\n",
      "now by force. Let it open by itself and come back of its own accord. After all I abused it much in\n",
      "the night when it was necessary to free and untie the various lines.\n",
      "He looked across the sea and knew how alone he was now. But he could see the prisms in the\n",
      "deep dark water and the line stretching ahead and the strange undulation of the calm. The clouds\n",
      "were building up now for the trade wind and he looked ahead and saw a [60] flight of wild ducks\n",
      "etching themselves against the sky over the water, then blurring, then etching again and he knew no\n",
      "man was ever alone on the sea.\n",
      "He thought of how some men feared being out of sight of land in a small boar and knew they\n",
      "were right in the months of sudden bad weather. But now they were in hurricane months and, when\n",
      "there are no hurricanes, the weather of hurricane months is the best of all the year.\n",
      "If there is a hurricane you always see the signs of it in the sky for days ahead, if you are at sea.\n",
      "They do not see it ashore because they do not know what to look for, he thought. The land must\n",
      "make a difference too, in the shape of the clouds. But we have no hurricane coming now.\n",
      "He looked at the sky and saw the white cumulus built like friendly piles of ice cream and high\n",
      "above were the thin feathers of the cirrus against the high September sky.\n",
      "“Light brisa,” he said. “Better weather for me than for you, fish.”\n",
      "His left hand was still cramped, but he was unknotting it slowly.\n",
      "Ernest Hemingway ?? The Old Man and the Sea\n",
      "17\n",
      "I hate a cramp, he thought. It is a treachery of one’s [61] own body. It is humiliating before\n",
      "others to have a diarrhoea from ptomaine poisoning or to vomit from it. But a cramp, he thought of\n",
      "it as a calambre, humiliates oneself especially when one is alone.\n",
      "If the boy were here he could rub it for me and loosen it down from the forearm, he thought.\n",
      "But it will loosen up.\n",
      "Then, with his right hand he felt the difference in the pull of the line before he saw the slant\n",
      "change in the water. Then, as he leaned against the line and slapped his left hand hard and fast\n",
      "against his thigh he saw the line slanting slowly upward.\n",
      "“He’s coming up,” he said. “Come on hand. Please come on.”\n",
      "The line rose slowly and steadily and then the surface of the ocean bulged ahead of the boat and\n",
      "the fish came out. He came out unendingly and water poured from his sides. He was bright in the\n",
      "sun and his head and back were dark purple and in the sun the stripes on his sides showed wide and\n",
      "a light lavender. His sword was as long as a baseball bat and tapered like a rapier and he rose his full\n",
      "length from the water and then re-entered it, smoothly, like a diver and the old [62] man saw the\n",
      "great scythe-blade of his tail go under and the line commenced to race out.\n",
      "“He is two feet longer than the skiff,” the old man said. The line was going out fast but steadily\n",
      "and the fish was not panicked. The old man was trying with both hands to keep the line just inside\n",
      "of breaking strength. He knew that if he could not slow the fish with a steady pressure the fish could\n",
      "take out all the line and break it.\n",
      "He is a great fish and I must convince him, he thought. I must never let him learn his strength\n",
      "nor what he could do if he made his run. If I were him I would put in everything now and go until\n",
      "something broke. But, thank God, they are not as intelligent as we who kill them; although they are\n",
      "more noble and more able.\n",
      "The old man had seen many great fish. He had seen many that weighed more than a thousand\n",
      "pounds and he had caught two of that size in his life, but never alone. Now alone, and out of sight\n",
      "of land, he was fast to the biggest fish that he had ever seen and bigger than he had ever heard of,\n",
      "and his left hand was still as tight as the gripped claws of an eagle.\n",
      "[63] It will uncramp though, he thought. Surely it will uncramp to help my right hand. There are\n",
      "three things that are brothers: the fish and my two hands. It must uncramp. It is unworthy of it to be\n",
      "cramped. The fish had slowed again and was going at his usual pace.\n",
      "I wonder why he jumped, the old man thought. He jumped almost as though to show me how\n",
      "big he was. I know now, anyway, he thought. I wish I could show him what sort of man I am. But\n",
      "then he would see the cramped hand. Let him think I am more man than I am and I will be so. I\n",
      "wish I was the fish, he thought, with everything he has against only my will and my intelligence.\n",
      "He settled comfortably against the wood and took his suffering as it came and the fish swam\n",
      "steadily and the boat moved slowly through the dark water. There was a small sea rising with the\n",
      "wind coming up from the east and at noon the old man’s left hand was uncramped.\n",
      "“Bad news for you, fish,” he said and shifted the line over the sacks that covered his shoulders.\n",
      "He was comfortable but suffering, although he did not admit the suffering at all.\n",
      "“I am not religious,” he said. “But I will say ten Our [64] Fathers and ten Hail Marys that I\n",
      "should catch this fish, and I promise to make a pilgrimage to the Virgin of Cobre if I catch him.\n",
      "That is a promise.”\n",
      "He commenced to say his prayers mechanically. Sometimes he would be so tired that he could\n",
      "not remember the prayer and then he would say them fast so that they would come automatically.\n",
      "Hail Marys are easier to say than Our Fathers, he thought.\n",
      "“Hail Mary full of Grace the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is\n",

      "though he is.”\n",
      "With his prayers said, and feeling much better, but suffering exactly as much, and perhaps a\n",
      "little more, he leaned against the wood of the bow and began, mechanically, to work the fingers of\n",
      "his left hand.\n",
      "The sun was hot now although the breeze was rising gently.\n",
      "“I had better re-bait that little line out over the stern,” he said. “If the fish decides to stay\n",
      "another night I will need to eat again and the water is low in the bottle. I don’t think I can get\n",
      "anything but a dolphin [65] here. But if I eat him fresh enough he won’t be bad. I wish a flying fish\n",
      "would come on board tonight. But I have no light to attract them. A flying fish is excellent to eat\n",
      "raw and I would not have to cut him up. I must save all my strength now. Christ, I did not know he\n",
      "was so big.”\n",
      "“I’ll kill him though,” he said. “In all his greatness and his glory.”\n",
      "Although it is unjust, he thought. But I will show him what a man can do and what a man\n",

      "“I told the boy I was a strange old man,” he said.\n",
      "“Now is when I must prove it.”\n",
      "The thousand times that he had proved it meant nothing. Now he was proving it again. Each\n",
      "time was a new time and he never thought about the past when he was doing it.\n",
      "I wish he’d sleep and I could sleep and dream about the lions, he thought. Why are the lions the\n",
      "main thing that is left? Don’t think, old man, he said to himself, Rest gently now against the wood\n",
      "and think of nothing. He is working. Work as little as you can.\n",
      "It was getting into the afternoon and the boat still moved slowly and steadily. But there was an\n",
      "added drag now from the easterly breeze and the old man [66] rode gently with the small sea and the\n",
      "hurt of the cord across his back came to him easily and smoothly.\n",
      "Once in the afternoon the line started to rise again. But the fish only continued to swim at a\n",
      "slightly higher level. The sun was on the old man’s left arm and shoulder and on his back. So he\n",
      "knew the fish had turned east of north.\n",
      "Now that he had seen him once, he could picture the fish swimming in the water with his\n",
      "purple pectoral fins set wide as wings and the great erect tail slicing through the dark. I wonder how\n",
      "much he sees at that depth, the old man thought. His eye is huge and a horse, with much less eye,\n",
      "can see in the dark. Once I could see quite well in the dark. Not in the absolute dark. But almost as a\n",
      "cat sees.\n",
      "The sun and his steady movement of his fingers had uncramped his left hand now completely\n",
      "and he began to shift more of the strain to it and he shrugged the muscles of his back to shift the\n",
      "hurt of the cord a little.\n",
      "“If you’re not tired, fish,” he said aloud, “you must be very strange.”\n",
      "He felt very tired now and he knew the night would come soon and he tried to think of other\n",
      "things. He thought of the Big Leagues, to him they were the Gran [67] Ligas, and he knew that the\n",

      "This is the second day now that I do not know the result of the juegos, he thought. But I must\n",
      "have confidence and I must be worthy of the great DiMaggio who does all things perfectly even\n",
      "with the pain of the bone spur in his heel. What is a bone spur? he asked himself. Un espuela de hueso.\n",
      "We do not have them. Can it be as painful as the spur of a fighting cock in one’s heel? I do not think\n",
      "I could endure that or the loss of the eye and of both eyes and continue to fight as the fighting cocks\n",
      "do. Man is not much beside the great birds and beasts. Still I would rather be that beast down there\n",
      "in the darkness of the sea.\n",

      "Do you believe the great DiMaggio would stay with a fish as long as I will stay with this one? he\n",
      "thought. I am sure he would and more since he is young and strong. Also his father was a fisherman.\n",
      "But would the bone spur hurt him too much?\n",

      "strongest man on the docks. They had gone one day and one night with their elbows on a chalk line\n",
      "on the table and their forearms straight up and their hands gripped tight. Each one was trying to\n",
      "force the other’s hand down onto the table. There was much betting and people went in and out of\n",
      "the room under the kerosene lights and he had looked at the arm and hand of the negro and at the\n",
      "negro’s face. They changed the referees every four hours after the first eight so that the referees\n",
      "could sleep. Blood came out from under the fingernails of both his and the negro’s hands and they\n",
      "looked each other in the eye and at their hands and forearms and the bettors went in and out of the\n",
      "room and sat on high chairs against the wall and watched. The walls were painted bright blue and\n",
      "were of wood and the lamps threw their shadows against them. The negro’s shadow was huge and it\n",
      "moved on the wall as the breeze moved the lamps.\n",
      "The odds would change back and forth all night and they fed the negro rum and lighted\n",
      "cigarettes for him.\n",
      "Then the negro, after the rum, would try for a tremendous [69] effort and once he had the old\n",
      "man, who was not an old man then but was Santiago El Campeon, nearly three inches off balance.\n",
      "But the old man had raised his hand up to dead even again. He was sure then that he had the negro,\n",

      "be called a draw and the referee was shaking his head, he had unleashed his effort and forced the\n",
      "hand of the negro down and down until it rested on the wood. The match had started on a Sunday\n",
      "morning and ended on a Monday morning. Many of the bettors had asked for a draw because they\n",
      "had to go to work on the docks loading sacks of sugar or at the Havana Coal Company. Otherwise\n",
      "everyone would have wanted it to go to a finish. But he had finished it anyway and before anyone\n",
      "had to go to work.\n",
      "For a long time after that everyone had called him The Champion and there had been a return\n",

      "broken the confidence of the negro from Cienfuegos in the first match. After that he had a few\n",
      "matches and then no more. He decided that he could beat anyone if he wanted to badly enough and\n",
      "he decided that it was bad for his right [70] hand for fishing. He had tried a few practice matches\n",
      "with his left hand. But his left hand had always been a traitor and would not do what he called on it\n",
      "to do and he did not trust it.\n",

      "until it shivered and was still.\n",
      "The old man unhooked the fish, re-baited the line with another sardine and tossed it over. Then\n",
      "he worked his way slowly back to the bow. He washed his left hand and wiped it on his trousers.\n",
      "Then he shifted the heavy line from his right hand to his left and washed his right hand in the sea\n",

      "“I’ll lash the two oars together across the stern and that will slow him in the night,” he said.\n",
      "“He’s good for the night and so am I.”\n",
      "It would be better to gut the dolphin a little later to save the blood in the meat, he thought. I\n",
      "can do that a little later and lash the oars to make a drag at the same time. I had better keep the fish\n",
      "quiet now and not disturb him too much at sunset. The setting of the sun is a difficult time for all\n",
      "fish. He let his hand dry in the air then grasped the line [73] with it and eased himself as much as he\n",
      "could and allowed himself to be pulled forward against the wood so that the boat took the strain as\n",
      "much, or more, than he did.\n",
      "I’m learning how to do it, he thought. This part of it anyway. Then too, remember he hasn’t\n",
      "eaten since he took the bait and he is huge and needs much food. I have eaten the whole bonito.\n",
      "Tomorrow I will eat the dolphin. He called it dorado. Perhaps I should eat some of it when I clean\n",
      "it. It will be harder to eat than the bonito. But, then, nothing is easy.\n",

      "any changes. The oars are a good trick; but it has reached the time to play for safety. He is much fish\n",
      "still and I saw that the hook was in the corner of his mouth and he has kept his mouth tight shut.\n",
      "The punishment of the hook is nothing. The punishment of hunger, and that he is against\n",
      "something that he does not comprehend, is everything. Rest now, old man, and let him work until\n",
      "your next duty comes.\n",
      "He rested for what he believed to be two hours. The moon did not rise now until late and he\n",
      "had no way of judging the time. Nor was he really resting except comparatively. He was still bearing\n",
      "the pull of the fish across his shoulders but he placed his left hand on the [76] gunwale of the bow\n",
      "and confided more and more of the resistance to the fish to the skiff itself.\n",
      "How simple it would be if I could make the line fast, he thought. But with one small lurch he\n",
      "could break it. I must cushion the pull of the line with my body and at all times be ready to give line\n",
      "with both hands.\n",
      "“But you have not slept yet, old man,” he said aloud. “It is half a day and a night and now\n",
      "another day and you have not slept. You must devise a way so that you sleep a little if he is quiet and\n",
      "steady. If you do not sleep you might become unclear in the head.”\n",
      "I’m clear enough in the head, he thought. Too clear. I am as clear as the stars that are my\n",
      "brothers. Still I must sleep. They sleep and the moon and the sun sleep and even the ocean sleeps\n",
      "sometimes on certain days when there is no current and a flat calm.\n",
      "But remember to sleep, he thought. Make yourself do it and devise some simple and sure way\n",
      "about the lines. Now go back and prepare the dolphin. It is too dangerous to rig the oars as a drag if\n",
      "you must sleep.\n",
      "I could go without sleeping, he told himself. But it would be too dangerous.\n",
      "[77] He started to work his way back to the stern on his hands and knees, being careful not to\n",
      "jerk against the fish. He may be half asleep himself, he thought. But I do not want him to rest. He\n",
      "must pull until he dies.\n",
      "Back in the stern he turned so that his left hand held the strain of the line across his shoulders\n",
      "and drew his knife from its sheath with his right hand. The stars were bright now and he saw the\n",
      "dolphin clearly and he pushed the blade of his knife into his head and drew him out from under the\n",
      "stern. He put one of his feet on the fish and slit him quickly from the vent up to the tip of his lower\n",
      "jaw. Then he put his knife down and gutted him with his right hand, scooping him clean and pulling\n",
      "the gills clear.\n",
      "He felt the maw heavy and slippery in his hands and he slit it open. There were two flying fish\n",
      "inside. They were fresh and hard and he laid them side by side and dropped the guts and the gills\n",
      "over the stern. They sank leaving a trail of phosphorescence in the water. The dolphin was cold and\n",
      "a leprous gray-white now in the starlight and the old man skinned one side of him while he held his\n",
      "Ernest Hemingway ?? The Old Man and the Sea\n",
      "22\n",
      "right foot on the fish’s head. Then he turned him over and skinned the other side and cut each side\n",
      "off from the head down to the tail.\n",
      "[78] He slid the carcass overboard and looked to see if there was any swirl in the water. But\n",
      "there was only the light of its slow descent. He turned then and placed the two flying fish inside the\n",
      "two fillets of fish and putting his knife back in its sheath, he worked his way slowly back to the bow.\n",
      "His back was bent with the weight of the line across it and he carried the fish in his right hand.\n",
      "Back in the bow he laid the two fillets of fish out on the wood with the flying fish beside them.\n",
      "After that he settled the line across his shoulders in a new place and held it again with his left hand\n",
      "resting on the gunwale. Then he leaned over the side and washed the flying fish in the water, noting\n",
      "the speed of the water against his hand. His hand was phosphorescent from skinning the fish and he\n",
      "watched the flow of the water against it. The flow was less strong and as he rubbed the side of his\n",
      "hand against the planking of the skiff, particles of phosphorus floated off and drifted slowly astern.\n",
      "“He is tiring or he is resting,” the old man said. “Now let me get through the eating of this\n",
      "dolphin and get some rest and a little sleep.”\n",
      "Under the stars and with the night colder all the [79] time he ate half of one of the dolphin\n",
      "fillets and one of the flying fish, gutted and with its head cut off.\n",
      "“What an excellent fish dolphin is to eat cooked,” he said. “And what a miserable fish raw. I\n",
      "will never go in a boat again without salt or limes.”\n",
      "If I had brains I would have splashed water on the bow all day and drying, it would have made\n",
      "salt, he thought. But then I did not hook the dolphin until almost sunset. Still it was a lack of\n",
      "preparation. But I have chewed it all well and I am not nauseated.\n",
      "The sky was clouding over to the east and one after another the stars he knew were gone. It\n",
      "looked now as though he were moving into a great canyon of clouds and the wind had dropped.\n",
      "“There will be bad weather in three or four days,” he said. “But not tonight and not tomorrow.\n",
      "Rig now to get some sleep, old man, while the fish is calm and steady.”\n",
      "He held the line tight in his right hand and then pushed his thigh against his right hand as he\n",
      "leaned all his weight against the wood of the bow. Then he passed the line a little lower on his\n",
      "shoulders and braced his left hand on it.\n",
      "My right hand can hold it as long as it is braced, he [80] thought If it relaxes in sleep my left\n",
      "hand will wake me as the line goes out. It is hard on the right hand. But he is used to punishment\n",
      "Even if I sleep twenty minutes or a half an hour it is good. He lay forward cramping himself against\n",
      "the line with all of his body, putting all his weight onto his right band, and he was asleep.\n",
      "He did not dream of the lions but instead of a vast school of porpoises that stretched for eight\n",
      "or ten miles and it was in the time of their mating and they would leap high into the air and return\n",
      "into the same hole they had made in the water when they leaped.\n",
      "Then he dreamed that he was in the village on his bed and there was a norther and he was very\n",
      "cold and his right arm was asleep because his head had rested on it instead of a pillow.\n",
      "After that he began to dream of the long yellow beach and he saw the first of the lions come\n",
      "down onto it in the early dark and then the other lions came and he rested his chin on the wood of\n",
      "the bows where the ship lay anchored with the evening off-shore breeze and he waited to see if\n",
      "there would be more lions and he was happy.\n",
      "The moon had been up for a long time but he slept [81] on and the fish pulled on steadily and\n",
      "the boat moved into the tunnel of clouds.\n",
      "He woke with the jerk of his right fist coming up against his face and the line burning out\n",
      "through his right hand. He had no feeling of his left hand but he braked all he could with his right\n",
      "and the line rushed out. Finally his left hand found the line and he leaned back against the line and\n",
      "now it burned his back and his left hand, and his left hand was taking all the strain and cutting badly.\n",
      "He looked back at the coils of line and they were feeding smoothly. Just then the fish jumped\n",
      "Ernest Hemingway ?? The Old Man and the Sea\n",
      "23\n",
      "making a great bursting of the ocean and then a heavy fall. Then he jumped again and again and the\n",
      "boat was going fast although line was still racing out and the old man was raising the strain to\n",
      "breaking point and raising it to breaking point again and again. He had been pulled down tight onto\n",
      "the bow and his face was in the cut slice of dolphin and he could not move.\n",
      "This is what we waited for, he thought. So now let us take it. Make him pay for the line, he\n",
      "thought. Make him pay for it.\n",
      "He could not see the fish’s jumps but only heard the [82] breaking of the ocean and the heavy\n",
      "splash as he fell. The speed of the line was cutting his hands badly but he had always known this\n",
      "would happen and he tried to keep the cutting across the calloused parts and not let the line slip into\n",
      "the palm nor cut the fingers.\n",
      "If the boy was here he would wet the coils of line, he thought. Yes. If the boy were here. If the\n",
      "boy were here.\n",
      "The line went out and out and out but it was slowing now and he was making the fish earn each\n",
      "inch of it. Now he got his head up from the wood and out of the slice of fish that his cheek had\n",
      "crushed. Then he was on his knees and then he rose slowly to his feet. He was ceding line but more\n",
      "slowly all he time. He worked back to where he could feel with his foot the coils of line that he\n",
      "could not see. There was plenty of line still and now the fish had to pull the friction of all that new\n",
      "line through the water.\n",
      "Yes, he thought. And now he has jumped more than a dozen times and filled the sacks along\n",
      "his back with air and he cannot go down deep to die where I cannot bring him up. He will start\n",
      "circling soon and then I must work on him. I wonder what started him so suddenly? Could it have\n",
      "been hunger that made him desperate, [83] or was he frightened by something in the night? Maybe\n",
      "he suddenly felt fear. But he was such a calm, strong fish and he seemed so fearless and so\n",
      "confident. It is strange.\n",
      "“You better be fearless and confident yourself, old man,” he said. “You’re holding him again\n",
      "but you cannot get line. But soon he has to circle.”\n",
      "The old man held him with his left hand and his shoulders now and stooped down and scooped\n",
      "up water in his right hand to get the crushed dolphin flesh off of his face. He was afraid that it might\n",
      "nauseate him and he would vomit and lose his strength. When his face was cleaned he washed his\n",
      "right hand in the water over the side and then let it stay in the salt water while he watched the first\n",
      "light come before the sunrise. He’s headed almost east, he thought. That means he is tired and going\n",
      "with the current. Soon he will have to circle. Then our true work begins.\n",
      "After he judged that his right hand had been in the water long enough he took it out and looked\n",
      "at it.\n",
      "“It is not bad,” he said. “And pain does not matter to a man.”\n",
      "He took hold of the line carefully so that it did not fit into any of the fresh line cuts and shifted\n",
      "his weight [84] so that he could put his left hand into the sea on the other side of the skiff.\n",
      "“You did not do so badly for something worthless,” he said to his left hand. “But there was a\n",
      "moment when I could not find you.”\n",
      "Why was I not born with two good hands? he thought. Perhaps it was my fault in not training\n",
      "that one properly. But God knows he has had enough chances to learn. He did not do so badly in\n",
      "the night, though, and he has only cramped once. If he cramps again let the line cut him off.\n",
      "When he thought that he knew that he was not being clear-headed and he thought he should\n",
      "chew some more of the dolphin. But I can’t, he told himself. It is better to be light-headed than to\n",
      "lose your strength from nausea. And I know I cannot keep it if I eat it since my face was in it. I will\n",
      "keep it for an emergency until it goes bad. But it is too late to try for strength now through\n",
      "nourishment. You’re stupid, he told himself. Eat the other flying fish.\n",
      "Ernest Hemingway ?? The Old Man and the Sea\n",
      "24\n",
      "It was there, cleaned and ready, and he picked it up with his left hand and ate it chewing the\n",
      "bones carefully and eating all of it down to the tail.\n",
      "It has more nourishment than almost any fish, he [85] thought. At least the kind of strength that\n",
      "I need. Now I have done what I can, he thought. Let him begin to circle and let the fight come.\n",
      "The sun was rising for the third time since he had put to sea when the fish started to circle.\n",
      "He could not see by the slant of the line that the fish was circling. It was too early for that. He\n",
      "just felt a faint slackening of the pressure of the line and he commenced to pull on it gently with his\n",
      "right hand. It tightened, as always, but just when he reached the point where it would break, line\n",
      "began to come in. He slipped his shoulders and head from under the line and began to pull in line\n",
      "steadily and gently. He used both of his hands in a swinging motion and tried to do the pulling as\n",
      "much as he could with his body and his legs. His old legs and shoulders pivoted with the swinging of\n",
      "the pulling.\n",
      "“It is a very big circle,” he said. “But he is circling.” Then the line would not come in any more\n",
      "and he held it until he saw the drops jumping from it in the sun. Then it started out and the old man\n",
      "knelt down and let it go grudgingly back into the dark water.\n",
      "“He is making the far part of his circle now,” he said. I must hold all I can, he thought. The\n",
      "strain will [86] shorten his circle each time. Perhaps in an hour I will see him. Now I must convince\n",
      "him and then I must kill him.\n",
      "But the fish kept on circling slowly and the old man was wet with sweat and tired deep into his\n",
      "bones two hours later. But the circles were much shorter now and from the way the line slanted he\n",
      "could tell the fish had risen steadily while he swam.\n",
      "For an hour the old man had been seeing black spots before his eyes and the sweat salted his\n",
      "eyes and salted the cut over his eye and on his forehead. He was not afraid of the black spots. They\n",
      "were normal at the tension that he was pulling on the line. Twice, though, he had felt faint and dizzy\n",
      "and that had worried him.\n",
      "“I could not fail myself and die on a fish like this,” he said. “Now that I have him coming so\n",
      "beautifully, God help me endure. I’ll say a hundred Our Fathers and a hundred Hail Marys. But I\n",
      "cannot say them now.\n",
      "Consider them said, he thought. I’ll say them later. Just then he felt a sudden banging and\n",
      "jerking on the line he held with his two hands. It was sharp and hard-feeling and heavy.\n",
      "He is hitting the wire leader with his spear, he [87] thought. That was bound to come. He had\n",
      "to do that. It may make him jump though and I would rather he stayed circling now. The jumps\n",
      "were necessary for him to take air. But after that each one can widen the opening of the hook\n",
      "wound and he can throw the hook.\n",
      "“Don’t jump, fish,” he said. “Don’t jump.”\n",
      "The fish hit the wire several times more and each time he shook his head the old man gave up a\n",
      "little line.\n",
      "I must hold his pain where it is, he thought. Mine does not matter. I can control mine. But his\n",
      "pain could drive him mad.\n",
      "After a while the fish stopped beating at the wire and started circling slowly again. The old man\n",
      "was gaining line steadily now. But he felt faint again. He lifted some sea water with his left hand and\n",
      "put it on his head. Then he put more on and rubbed the back of his neck.\n",
      "“I have no cramps,” he said. “He’ll be up soon and I can last. You have to last. Don’t even\n",
      "speak of it.”\n",
      "He kneeled against the bow and, for a moment, slipped the line over his back again. I’ll rest\n",
      "now while he goes out on the circle and then stand up and work on him when he comes in, he\n",
      "decided.\n",
      "Ernest Hemingway ?? The Old Man and the Sea\n",
      "25\n",
      "[88] It was a great temptation to rest in the bow and let the fish make one circle by himself\n",
      "without recovering any line. But when the strain showed the fish had turned to come toward the\n",
      "boat, the old man rose to his feet and started the pivoting and the weaving pulling that brought in all\n",
      "the line he gained.\n",
      "I’m tireder than I have ever been, he thought, and now the trade wind is rising. But that will be\n",
      "good to take him in with. I need that badly.\n",
      "“I’ll rest on the next turn as he goes out,” he said. “I feel much better. Then in two or three\n",
      "turns more I will have him.”\n",
      "His straw hat was far on the back of his head and he sank down into the bow with the pull of\n",
      "the line as he felt the fish turn.\n",
      "You work now, fish, he thought. I’ll take you at the turn.\n",
      "The sea had risen considerably. But it was a fair-weather breeze and he had to have it to get\n",
      "home.\n",
      "“I’ll just steer south and west,” he said. “A man is never lost at sea and it is a long island.”\n",
      "It was on the third turn that he saw the fish first.\n",
      "He saw him first as a dark shadow that took so long [89] to pass under the boat that he could\n",
      "not believe its length.\n",
      "“No,” he said. “He can’t be that big.”\n",
      "But he was that big and at the end of this circle he came to the surface only thirty yards away\n",
      "and the man saw his tail out of water. It was higher than a big scythe blade and a very pale lavender\n",
      "above the dark blue water. It raked back and as the fish swam just below the surface the old man\n",
      "could see his huge bulk and the purple stripes that banded him. His dorsal fin was down and his\n",
      "huge pectorals were spread wide.\n",
      "On this circle the old man could see the fish’s eye and the two gray sucking fish that swain\n",
      "around him. Sometimes they attached themselves to him. Sometimes they darted off. Sometimes\n",
      "they would swim easily in his shadow. They were each over three feet long and when they swam fast\n",
      "they lashed their whole bodies like eels.\n",
      "The old man was sweating now but from something else besides the sun. On each calm placid\n",
      "turn the fish made he was gaining line and he was sure that in two turns more he would have a\n",
      "chance to get the harpoon in.\n",
      "[90] But I must get him close, close, close, he thought. I mustn’t try for the head. I must get the\n",
      "heart.\n",
      "“Be calm and strong, old man,” he said.\n",
      "On the next circle the fish’s beck was out but he was a little too far from the boat. On the next\n",
      "circle he was still too far away but he was higher out of water and the old man was sure that by\n",
      "gaining some more line he could have him alongside.\n",
      "He had rigged his harpoon long before and its coil of light rope was in a round basket and the\n",
      "end was made fast to the bitt in the bow.\n",
      "The fish was coming in on his circle now calm and beautiful looking and only his great tail\n",
      "moving. The old man pulled on him all that he could to bring him closer. For just a moment the fish\n",
      "turned a little on his side. Then he straightened himself and began another circle.\n",
      "“I moved him,” the old man said. “I moved him then.”\n",
      "He felt faint again now but he held on the great fish all the strain that he could. I moved him,\n",
      "he thought. Maybe this time I can get him over. Pull, hands, he thought. Hold up, legs. Last for me,\n",
      "head. Last for me. You never went. This time I’ll pull him over.\n",
      "[91] But when he put all of his effort on, starting it well out before the fish came alongside and\n",
      "pulling with all his strength, the fish pulled part way over and then righted himself and swam away.\n",
      "Ernest Hemingway ?? The Old Man and the Sea\n",
      "26\n",
      "“Fish,” the old man said. “Fish, you are going to have to die anyway. Do you have to kill me\n",
      "too?”\n",
      "That way nothing is accomplished, he thought. His mouth was too dry to speak but he could\n",
      "not reach for the water now. I must get him alongside this time, he thought. I am not good for many\n",
      "more turns. Yes you are, he told himself. You’re good for ever.\n",
      "On the next turn, he nearly had him. But again the fish righted himself and swam slowly away.\n",
      "You are killing me, fish, the old man thought. But you have a right to. Never have I seen a\n",
      "greater, or more beautiful, or a calmer or more noble thing than you, brother. Come on and kill me.\n",
      "I do not care who kills who.\n",
      "Now you are getting confused in the head, he thought. You must keep your head clear. Keep\n",
      "your head clear and know how to suffer like a man. Or a fish, he thought.\n",
      "“Clear up, head,” he said in a voice he could hardly hear. “Clear up.”\n",
      "[92] Twice more it was the same on the turns.\n",
      "I do not know, the old man thought. He had been on the point of feeling himself go each time.\n",
      "I do not know. But I will try it once more.\n",
      "He tried it once more and he felt himself going when he turned the fish. The fish righted\n",
      "himself and swam off again slowly with the great tail weaving in the air.\n",
      "I’ll try it again, the old man promised, although his hands were mushy now and he could only\n",
      "see well in flashes.\n",
      "He tried it again and it was the same. So he thought, and he felt himself going before he started;\n",
      "I will try it once again.\n",
      "He took all his pain and what was left of his strength and his long gone pride and he put it\n",
      "against the fish’s agony and the fish came over onto his side and swam gently on his side, his bill\n",
      "almost touching the planking of the skiff and started to pass the boat, long, deep, wide, silver and\n",
      "barred with purple and interminable in the water.\n",
      "The old man dropped the line and put his foot on it and lifted the harpoon as high as he could\n",
      "and drove it down with all his strength, and more strength he had [93] just summoned, into the\n",
      "fish’s side just behind the great chest fin that rose high in the air to the altitude of the man’s chest.\n",
      "He felt the iron go in and he leaned on it and drove it further and then pushed all his weight after it.\n",
      "Then the fish came alive, with his death in him, and rose high out of the water showing all his\n",
      "great length and width and all his power and his beauty. He seemed to hang in the air above the old\n",
      "man in the skiff. Then he fell into the water with a crash that sent spray over the old man and over\n",
      "all of the skiff.\n",
      "The old man felt faint and sick and he could not see well. But he cleared the harpoon line and\n",
      "let it run slowly through his raw hands and, when he could see, he saw the fish was on his back with\n",
      "his silver belly up. The shaft of the harpoon was projecting at an angle from the fish’s shoulder and\n",
      "the sea was discolouring with the red of the blood from his heart. First it was dark as a shoal in the\n",
      "blue water that was more than a mile deep. Then it spread like a cloud. The fish was silvery and still\n",
      "and floated with the waves.\n",
      "The old man looked carefully in the glimpse of vision that he had. Then he took two turns of\n",
      "the harpoon [94] line around the bitt in the bow and hid his head on his hands.\n",
      "“Keep my head dear,” he said against the wood of the bow. “I am a tired old man. But I have\n",
      "killed this fish which is my brother and now I must do the slave work.”\n",

      "touch and to feel him. He is my fortune, he thought. But that is not why I wish to feel him. I think I\n",
      "felt his heart, he thought. When I pushed on the harpoon shaft the second time. Bring him in now\n",

      "He looked up at the sky and then out to his fish. He looked at the sun carefully. It is not much\n",

      "When he was even with him and had the fish’s head against the bow he could not believe his\n",
      "size. But he untied the harpoon rope from the bitt, passed it through the fish’s gills and out his jaws,\n",
      "made a turn around his sword then passed the rope through the other gill, made another turn\n",
      "around the bill and knotted the double rope and made it fast to the bitt in the bow. He cut the rope\n",
      "then and went astern to noose the tail. The fish had turned silver from his original purple and silver,\n",
      "and the stripes showed the same pale violet colour as his tail. They were wider than a man’s hand\n",
      "with his fingers spread and the fish’s eye looked as detached as the mirrors in a periscope or as a\n",
      "saint in a procession.\n",
      "[96] “It was the only way to kill him,” the old man said. He was feeling better since the water\n",
      "and he knew he would not go away and his head was clear. He’s over fifteen hundred pounds the\n",
      "way he is, he thought. Maybe much more. If he dresses out two-thirds of that at thirty cents a\n",
      "pound?\n",
      "“I need a pencil for that,” he said. “My head is not that clear. But I think the great DiMaggio\n",
      "would be proud of me today. I had no bone spurs. But the hands and the back hurt truly.” I wonder\n",
      "what a bone spur is, he thought. Maybe we have them without knowing of it.\n",
      "He made the fish fast to bow and stern and to the middle thwart. He was so big it was like\n",
      "lashing a much bigger skiff alongside. He cut a piece of line and tied the fish’s lower jaw against his\n",
      "bill so his mouth would not open and they would sail as cleanly as possible. Then he stepped the\n",
      "mast and, with the stick that was his gaff and with his boom rigged, the patched sail drew, the boat\n",
      "began to move, and half lying in the stern he sailed south-west.\n",
      "He did not need a compass to tell him where southwest was. He only needed the feel of the\n",
      "trade wind and the drawing of the sail. I better put a small line [97] out with a spoon on it and try\n",
      "and get something to eat and drink for the moisture. But he could not find a spoon and his sardines\n",
      "were rotten. So he hooked a patch of yellow Gulf weed with the gaff as they passed and shook it so\n",
      "that the small shrimps that were in it fell onto the planking of the skiff. There were more than a\n",
      "dozen of them and they jumped and kicked like sand fleas. The old man pinched their heads off\n",
      "with his thumb and forefinger and ate them chewing up the shells and the tails. They were very tiny\n",
      "but he knew they were nourishing and they tasted good.\n",
      "The old man still had two drinks of water in the bottle and he used half of one after he had\n",
      "eaten the shrimps. The skiff was sailing well considering the handicaps and he steered with the tiller\n",

      "there is. All I must do is keep the head clear. The hands have done their work and we sail well. With\n",
      "his mouth shut and his tail straight up and down we sail like brothers. Then his head started to\n",

      "and he meant me no harm.\n",

      "The shark was not an accident. He had come up from deep down in the water as the dark cloud\n",
      "of blood had settled and dispersed in the mile deep sea. He had come up so fast and absolutely\n",
      "without caution that he broke the surface of the blue water and was in the sun. Then he fell back\n",
      "into the sea and picked up the scent and started swimming on the course the skiff and the fish had\n",
      "taken.\n",
      "Sometimes he lost the scent. But he would pick it up again, or have just a trace of it, and he\n",
      "swam fast and hard on the course. He was a very big Make shark built to swim as fast as the fastest\n",
      "fish in the sea and everything about him was beautiful except his jaws. His back was as blue as a\n",
      "sword fish’s and his belly was silver and his hide was smooth and handsome. He was built as a\n",
      "sword fish except for his huge jaws which were tight shut now as he swam fast, just under the\n",
      "surface with his high dorsal fin knifing through the water without wavering. Inside the closed double\n",
      "lip of his jaws all of his eight rows of teeth were slanted inwards. They were not the ordinary\n",
      "pyramid-shaped teeth of most sharks. They were shaped like a man’s [100] fingers when they are\n",
      "crisped like claws. They were nearly as long as the fingers of the old man and they had razor-sharp\n",
      "cutting edges on both sides. This was a fish built to feed on all the fishes in the sea, that were so fast\n",
      "and strong and well armed that they had no other enemy. Now he speeded up as he smelled the\n",
      "fresher scent and his blue dorsal fin cut the water.\n",
      "When the old man saw him coming he knew that this was a shark that had no fear at all and\n",
      "would do exactly what he wished. He prepared the harpoon and made the rope fast while he\n",
      "watched the shark come on. The rope was short as it lacked what he had cut away to lash the fish.\n",
      "The old man’s head was clear and good now and he was full of resolution but he had little\n",
      "hope. It was too good to last, he thought. He took one look at the great fish as he watched the shark\n",

      "maybe I can get him. Dentuso, he thought. Bad luck to your mother.\n",
      "The shark closed fast astern and when he hit the fish the old man saw his mouth open and his\n",
      "strange eyes and the clicking chop of the teeth as he drove forward in the meat just above the tail.\n",
      "The shark’s head [101] was out of water and his back was coming out and the old man could hear\n",
      "the noise of skin and flesh ripping on the big fish when he rammed the harpoon down onto the\n",
      "shark’s head at a spot where the line between his eyes intersected with the line that ran straight back\n",
      "from his nose. There were no such lines. There was only the heavy sharp blue head and the big eyes\n",
      "and the clicking, thrusting all-swallowing jaws. But that was the location of the brain and the old\n",
      "man hit it. He hit it with his blood mushed hands driving a good harpoon with all his strength. He\n",
      "hit it without hope but with resolution and complete malignancy.\n",
      "The shark swung over and the old man saw his eye was not alive and then he swung over once\n",
      "again, wrapping himself in two loops of the rope. The old man knew that he was dead but the shark\n",
      "would not accept it. Then, on his back, with his tail lashing and his jaws clicking, the shark plowed\n",
      "Ernest Hemingway ?? The Old Man and the Sea\n",
      "29\n",
      "over the water as a speedboat does. The water was white where his tail beat it and three-quarters of\n",
      "his body was clear above the water when the rope came taut, shivered, and then snapped. The shark\n",
      "lay quietly for a little while on the surface and the old man watched him. Then he went down very\n",
      "slowly.\n",
      "[102] “He took about forty pounds,” the old man said aloud. He took my harpoon too and all\n",
      "the rope, he thought, and now my fish bleeds again and there will be others.\n",
      "He did not like to look at the fish anymore since he had been mutilated. When the fish had\n",
      "been hit it was as though he himself were hit.\n",
      "But I killed the shark that hit my fish, he thought. And he was the biggest dentuso that I have\n",

      "sorry that I killed the fish though, he thought. Now the bad time is coming and I do not even have\n",
      "the harpoon. The dentuso is cruel and able and strong and intelligent. But I was more intelligent\n",
      "than he was. Perhaps not, he thought. Perhaps I was only better armed.\n",

      "But I must think, he thought. Because it is all I have left. That and baseball. I wonder how the\n",
      "great [103] DiMaggio would have liked the way I hit him in the brain? It was no great thing, he\n",
      "thought. Any man could do it. But do you think my hands were as great a handicap as the bone\n",
      "spurs? I cannot know. I never had anything wrong with my heel except the time the sting ray stung it\n",
      "when I stepped on him when swimming and paralyzed the lower leg and made the unbearable pain.\n",

      "home. You sail lighter for the loss of forty pounds.”\n",
      "He knew quite well the pattern of what could happen when he reached the inner part of the\n",
      "current. But there was nothing to be done now.\n",
      "“Yes there is,” he said aloud. “I can lash my knife to the butt of one of the oars.”\n",
      "So he did that with the tiller under his arm and the sheet of the sail under his foot.\n",
      "“Now,” he said. “I am still an old man. But I am not unarmed.”\n",
      "The breeze was fresh now and he sailed on well. He watched only the forward part of the fish\n",
      "and some of his hope returned.\n",
      "It is silly not to hope, he thought. Besides I believe [104] it is a sin. Do not think about sin, he\n",
      "thought. There are enough problems now without sin. Also I have no understanding of it.\n",
      "I have no understanding of it and I am not sure that I believe in it. Perhaps it was a sin to kill\n",

      "not a sin to kill him. Or is it more?\n",

      "But you enjoyed killing the dentuso, he thought. He lives on the live fish as you do. He is not a\n",

      "no fear of anything.\n",

      "He leaned over the side and pulled loose a piece of the meat of the fish where the shark had cut\n",
      "him. He chewed it and noted its quality and its good taste. It was firm and juicy, like meat, but it was\n",

      "The breeze was steady. It had backed a little further into the north-east and he knew that meant\n",
      "that it would not fall off. The old man looked ahead of him but he could see no sails nor could he\n",

      "from the marlin, trying to rest and to be strong, when he saw the first of the two sharks.\n",
      "“Ay,” he said aloud. There is no translation for this word and perhaps it is just a noise such as a\n",
      "man might make, involuntarily, feeling the nail go through his hands and into the wood.\n",
      "“Galanos,” he said aloud. He had seen the second fin now coming up behind the first and had\n",

      "and closed them on it lightly to loosen them. He closed them firmly so they would take the pain now\n",
      "and would not flinch and watched the sharks come. He could see their wide, flattened, shovelpointed\n",
      "heads now and their white tipped wide pectoral fins. They were hateful sharks, [107] bad\n",
      "smelling, scavengers as well as killers, and when they were hungry they would bite at an oar or the\n",

      "now made a trail for all sharks as wide as a highway through the sea.\n",
      "He was a fish to keep a man all winter, he thought Don’t think of that. Just rest and try to get\n",

      "worry. Many others too, he thought. I live in a good town.\n",

      "something came into his head.\n",
      "“Half fish,” he said. “Fish that you were. I am sorry that I went too far out. I ruined us both.\n",

      "he thought. Maybe I’ll have the luck to bring the forward half in. I should have some luck. No, he\n",
      "said. You violated your luck when you went too far outside.\n",

      "“I’d like to buy some if there’s any place they sell it,” he said.\n",

      "“You might,” he said. “You tried to buy it with [116] eighty-four days at sea. They nearly sold it\n",
      "to you too.”\n",
      "I must not think nonsense, he thought. Luck is a thing that comes in many forms and who can\n",
      "recognize her? I would take some though in any form and pay what they asked. I wish I could see\n",
      "the glow from the lights, he thought. I wish too many things. But that is the thing I wish for now.\n",
      "He tried to settle more comfortably to steer and from his pain he knew he was not dead.\n",
      "He saw the reflected glare of the lights of the city at what must have been around ten o’clock at\n",
      "night. They were only perceptible at first as the light is in the sky before the moon rises. Then they\n",
      "were steady to see across the ocean which was rough now with the increasing breeze. He steered\n",
      "inside of the glow and he thought that now, soon, he must hit the edge of the stream.\n",
      "Now it is over, he thought. They will probably hit me again. But what can a man do against\n",
      "them in the dark without a weapon?\n",
      "He was stiff and sore now and his wounds and all of the strained parts of his body hurt with the\n",
      "cold of the night. I hope I do not have to fight again, he thought. I hope so much I do not have to\n",
      "fight again.\n",
      "[117] But by midnight he fought and this time he knew the fight was useless. They came in a\n",
      "pack and he could only see the lines in the water that their fins made and their phosphorescence as\n",
      "they threw themselves on the fish. He clubbed at heads and heard the jaws chop and the shaking of\n",
      "the skiff as they took hold below. He clubbed desperately at what he could only feel and hear and he\n",
      "felt something seize the club and it was gone.\n",
      "He jerked the tiller free from the rudder and beat and chopped with it, holding it in both hands\n",
      "and driving it down again and again. But they were up to the bow now and driving in one after the\n",
      "other and together, tearing off the pieces of meat that showed glowing below the sea as they turned\n",
      "to come once more.\n",
      "One came, finally, against the head itself and he knew that it was over. He swung the tiller\n",
      "across the shark’s head where the jaws were caught in the heaviness of the fish’s head which would\n",
      "not tear. He swung it once and twice and again. He heard the tiller break and he lunged at the shark\n",
      "with the splintered butt. He felt it go in and knowing it was sharp he drove it in again. The shark let\n",
      "go and rolled away. That was the [118] last shark of the pack that came. There was nothing more for\n",
      "them to eat.\n",
      "The old man could hardly breathe now and he felt a strange taste in his mouth. It was coppery\n",
      "and sweet and he was afraid of it for a moment. But there was not much of it.\n",
      "He spat into the ocean and said, “Eat that, galanos. And make a dream you’ve killed a man.”\n",
      "He knew he was beaten now finally and without remedy and he went back to the stern and\n",
      "found the jagged end of the tiller would fit in the slot of the rudder well enough for him to steer. He\n",
      "settled the sack around his shoulders and put the skiff on her course. He sailed lightly now and he\n",
      "had no thoughts nor any feelings of any kind. He was past everything now and he sailed the skiff to\n",
      "make his home port as well and as intelligently as he could. In the night sharks hit the carcass as\n",
      "someone might pick up crumbs from the table. The old man paid no attention to them and did not\n",
      "pay any attention to anything except steering. He only noticed how lightly and bow well the skiff\n",

      "34\n",
      "[119] She’s good, he thought. She is sound and not harmed in any way except for the tiller. That\n",
      "is easily replaced.\n",
      "He could feel he was inside the current now and he could see the lights of the beach colonies\n",
      "along the shore. He knew where he was now and it was nothing to get home.\n",
      "The wind is our friend, anyway, he thought. Then he added, sometimes. And the great sea with\n",
      "our friends and our enemies. And bed, he thought. Bed is my friend. Just bed, he thought. Bed will\n",
      "be a great thing. It is easy when you are beaten, he thought. I never knew how easy it was. And what\n",
      "beat you, he thought.\n",
      "“Nothing,” he said aloud. “I went out too far.”\n",
      "When he sailed into the little harbour the lights of the Terrace were out and he knew everyone\n",

      "though and he sailed up onto the little patch of shingle below the rocks. There was no one to help\n",
      "him so he pulled the boat up as far as he could. Then he stepped out and made her fast to a rock.\n",
      "[120] He unstepped the mast and furled the sail and tied it. Then he shouldered the mast and\n",
      "started to climb. It was then he knew the depth of his tiredness. He stopped for a moment and\n",
      "looked back and saw in the reflection from the street light the great tail of the fish standing up well\n",
      "behind the skiff’s stern. He saw the white naked line of his backbone and the dark mass of the head\n",
      "with the projecting bill and all the nakedness between.\n",
      "He started to climb again and at the top he fell and lay for some time with the mast across his\n",
      "shoulder. He tried to get up. But it was too difficult and he sat there with the mast on his shoulder\n",
      "and looked at the road. A cat passed on the far side going about its business and the old man\n",
      "watched it. Then he just watched the road.\n",
      "Finally he put the mast down and stood up. He picked the mast up and put it on his shoulder\n",
      "and started up the road. He had to sit down five times before he reached his shack.\n",
      "Inside the shack he leaned the mast against the wall. In the dark he found a water bottle and\n",
      "took a drink. Then he lay down on the bed. He pulled the blanket [121] over his shoulders and then\n",
      "over his back and legs and he slept face down on the newspapers with his arms out straight and the\n",
      "palms of his hands up.\n",
      "He was asleep when the boy looked in the door in the morning. It was blowing so hard that the\n",

      "shack as he had come each morning. The boy saw that the old man was breathing and then he saw\n",

      "all the way down the road he was crying.\n",
      "Many fishermen were around the skiff looking at what was lashed beside it and one was in the\n",

      "The boy did not go down. He had been there before and one of the fishermen was looking\n",

      "“How is he?” one of the fishermen shouted.\n",

      "To Charlie Shribner\n",

      "To Max Perkins\n",
      "He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty-four\n",
      "days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him. But after forty days\n",
      "without a fish the boy’s parents had told him that the old man was now definitely and finally salao,\n",
      "which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone at their orders in another boat which\n",
      "caught three good fish the first week. It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with\n",
      "his skiff empty and he always went down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and\n",
      "harpoon and the sail that was furled around the mast. The sail was patched with flour sacks and,\n",
      "furled, it looked like the flag of permanent defeat.\n",
      "The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck. The brown\n",
      "blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its [9] reflection on the tropic sea were\n",
      "on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased\n",
      "scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. But none of these scars were fresh. They were as old as\n",
      "erosions in a fishless desert.\n",
      "Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the sea and were\n",
      "cheerful and undefeated.\n",
      "“Santiago,” the boy said to him as they climbed the bank from where the skiff was hauled up. “I\n",
      "could go with you again. We’ve made some money.”\n",
      "The old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him.\n",
      "“No,” the old man said. “You’re with a lucky boat. Stay with them.”\n",
      "“But remember how you went eighty-seven days without fish and then we caught big ones\n",
      "every day for three weeks.”\n",
      "“I remember,” the old man said. “I know you did not leave me because you doubted.”\n",
      "“It was papa made me leave. I am a boy and I must obey him.”\n",
      "“I know,” the old man said. “It is quite normal.”\n",
      "“He hasn’t much faith.”\n",
      "[10] “No,” the old man said. “But we have. Haven’t we?”\n",
      "‘Yes,” the boy said. “Can I offer you a beer on the Terrace and then we’ll take the stuff home.”\n",
      "“Why not?” the old man said. “Between fishermen.”\n",
      "They sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the old man and he was not\n",
      "angry. Others, of the older fishermen, looked at him and were sad. But they did not show it and they\n",
      "spoke politely about the current and the depths they had drifted their lines at and the steady good\n",
      "weather and of what they had seen. The successful fishermen of that day were already in and had\n",
      "butchered their marlin out and carried them laid full length across two planks, with two men\n",
      "Ernest Hemingway ?? The Old Man and the Sea\n",
      "2\n",
      "staggering at the end of each plank, to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck to carry\n",
      "them to the market in Havana. Those who had caught sharks had taken them to the shark factory on\n",
      "the other side of the cove where they were hoisted on a block and tackle, their livers removed, their\n",
      "fins cut off and their hides skinned out and their flesh cut into strips for salting.\n",
      "When the wind was in the east a smell came across the harbour from the shark factory; but\n",
      "today there [11] was only the faint edge of the odour because the wind had backed into the north\n",
      "and then dropped off and it was pleasant and sunny on the Terrace.\n",
      "“Santiago,” the boy said.\n",
      "“Yes,” the old man said. He was holding his glass and thinking of many years ago.\n",
      "“Can I go out to get sardines for you for tomorrow?”\n",
      "“No. Go and play baseball. I can still row and Rogelio will throw the net.”\n",
      "“I would like to go. If I cannot fish with you. I would like to serve in some way.”\n",
      "“You bought me a beer,” the old man said. “You are already a man.”\n",
      "“How old was I when you first took me in a boat?”\n",
      "“Five and you nearly were killed when I brought the fish in too green and he nearly tore the\n",
      "boat to pieces. Can you remember?”\n",
      "“I can remember the tail slapping and banging and the thwart breaking and the noise of the\n",
      "clubbing. I can remember you throwing me into the bow where the wet coiled lines were and feeling\n",
      "the whole boat shiver and the noise of you clubbing him like chopping a tree down and the sweet\n",
      "blood smell all over me.”\n",
      "[12] “Can you really remember that or did I just tell it to you?”\n",
      "“I remember everything from when we first went together.”\n",
      "The old man looked at him with his sun-burned, confident loving eyes.\n",
      "“If you were my boy I’d take you out and gamble,” he said. “But you are your father’s and your\n",

      "when luck comes you are ready.\n",

      "east. There were only three boats in sight now and they showed very low and far inshore.\n",
      "All my life the early sun has hurt my eyes, he thought. Yet they are still good. In the evening I\n",

      "Just then he saw a man-of-war bird with his long black wings circling in the sky ahead of him.\n",
      "He made a quick drop, slanting down on his back-swept wings, and then circled again.\n",
      "“He’s got something,” the old man said aloud. “He’s not just looking.”\n",
      "He rowed slowly and steadily toward where the bird was circling. He did not hurry and he kept\n",

      "medium-sized hook and he baited it with one of the sardines. He let it go over the side and then\n",
      "made it fast to a ring bolt in the stern. Then he baited another line and left it coiled in the shade of\n",
      "the bow. He went back to rowing and to watching the long-winged black bird who was working,\n",
      "now, low over the water.\n",
      "As he watched the bird dipped again slanting his wings for the dive and then swinging them\n",
      "wildly and ineffectually as he followed the flying fish. The old man could see the slight bulge in the\n",

      "9\n",
      "through the water below the flight of the fish and would be in the water, driving at speed, when the\n",
      "fish dropped. It is a big school of dolphin, he thought. They are widespread and the flying fish have\n",
      "little chance. The bird has no chance. The flying fish are too big for him and they go too fast.\n",
      "He watched the flying fish burst out again and again and the ineffectual movements of the bird.\n",
      "That school has gotten away from me, he thought. They are moving out too fast and too far. But\n",

      "somewhere.\n",
      "The clouds over the land now rose like mountains and the coast was only a long green line with\n",
      "the gray blue hills behind it. The water was a dark blue now, so dark that it was almost purple. As he\n",
      "looked down into it he saw the red sifting of the plankton in the dark water and the strange light the\n",
      "sun made now. He watched his lines to see them go straight down out of sight into the water and he\n",
      "was happy to see so much plankton because it meant fish. The strange light the sun made in the\n",
      "water, now that the sun was higher, meant good weather and so did the shape of the clouds over the\n",
      "land. But the bird was almost out of sight now and nothing showed on the surface of the water but\n",
      "some patches of yellow, sun-bleached Sargasso weed and the purple, formalized, iridescent,\n",
      "gelatinous bladder of a Portuguese man-of-war floating dose beside the boat. It turned on its side\n",
      "and then righted itself. It floated cheerfully as a bubble with its long deadly purple filaments trailing\n",
      "a yard behind it in the water.\n",
      "“Agua mala,” the man said. “You whore.”\n",
      "From where he swung lightly against his oars he looked down into the water and saw the tiny\n",
      "fish that [35] were coloured like the trailing filaments and swam between them and under the small\n",
      "shade the bubble made as it drifted. They were immune to its poison. But men were not and when\n",
      "same of the filaments would catch on a line and rest there slimy and purple while the old man was\n",
      "working a fish, he would have welts and sores on his arms and hands of the sort that poison ivy or\n",
      "poison oak can give. But these poisonings from the agua mala came quickly and struck like a\n",
      "whiplash.\n",
      "The iridescent bubbles were beautiful. But they were the falsest thing in the sea and the old man\n",
      "loved to see the big sea turtles eating them. The turtles saw them, approached them from the front,\n",
      "then shut their eyes so they were completely carapaced and ate them filaments and all. The old man\n",
      "loved to see the turtles eat them and he loved to walk on them on the beach after a storm and hear\n",
      "them pop when he stepped on them with the horny soles of his feet.\n",
      "He loved green turtles and hawk-bills with their elegance and speed and their great value and he\n",
      "had a friendly contempt for the huge, stupid loggerheads, yellow in their armour-plating, strange in\n",
      "their [36] love-making, and happily eating the Portuguese men-of-war with their eyes shut.\n",
      "He had no mysticism about turtles although he had gone in turtle boats for many years. He was\n",
      "sorry for them all, even the great trunk backs that were as long as the skiff and weighed a ton. Most\n",
      "people are heartless about turtles because a turtle’s heart will beat for hours after he has been cut up\n",
      "and butchered. But the old man thought, I have such a heart too and my feet and hands are like\n",
      "theirs. He ate the white eggs to give himself strength. He ate them all through May to be strong in\n",
      "September and October for the truly big fish.\n",
      "He also drank a cup of shark liver oil each day from the big drum in the shack where many of\n",
      "the fishermen kept their gear. It was there for all fishermen who wanted it. Most fishermen hated\n",
      "the taste. But it was no worse than getting up at the hours that they rose and it was very good against\n",
      "all colds and grippes and it was good for the eyes.\n",
      "Now the old man looked up and saw that the bird was circling again.\n",
      "“He’s found fish,” he said aloud. No flying fish broke the surface and there was no scattering of\n",
      "bait [37] fish. But as the old man watched, a small tuna rose in the air, turned and dropped head first\n",
      "into the water. The tuna shone silver in the sun and after he had dropped back into the water\n",
      "Ernest Hemingway ?? The Old Man and the Sea\n",
      "10\n",
      "another and another rose and they were jumping in all directions, churning the water and leaping in\n",
      "long jumps after the bait. They were circling it and driving it.\n",
      "If they don’t travel too fast I will get into them, the old man thought, and he watched the\n",
      "school working the water white and the bird now dropping and dipping into the bait fish that were\n",
      "forced to the surface in their panic.\n",
      "“The bird is a great help,” the old man said. Just then the stern line came taut under his foot,\n",
      "where he had kept a loop of the line, and he dropped his oars and felt tile weight of the small tuna’s\n",
      "shivering pull as he held the line firm and commenced to haul it in. The shivering increased as he\n",
      "pulled in and he could see the blue back of the fish in the water and the gold of his sides before he\n",
      "swung him over the side and into the boat. He lay in the stern in the sun, compact and bullet\n",
      "shaped, his big, unintelligent eyes staring as he thumped his life out against the planking of the boat\n",
      "with the quick shivering strokes of his neat, fast-moving [38] tail. The old man hit him on the head\n",
      "for kindness and kicked him, his body still shuddering, under the shade of the stern.\n",
      "“Albacore,” he said aloud. “He’ll make a beautiful bait. He’ll weigh ten pounds.”\n",
      "He did not remember when he had first started to talk aloud when he was by himself. He had\n",
      "sung when he was by himself in the old days and he had sung at night sometimes when he was alone\n",
      "steering on his watch in the smacks or in the turtle boats. He had probably started to talk aloud,\n",
      "when alone, when the boy had left. But he did not remember. When he and the boy fished together\n",
      "they usually spoke only when it was necessary. They talked at night or when they were storm-bound\n",
      "by bad weather. It was considered a virtue not to talk unnecessarily at sea and the old man had\n",
      "always considered it so and respected it. But now he said his thoughts aloud many times since there\n",
      "was no one that they could annoy.\n",
      "“If the others heard me talking out loud they would think that I am crazy,” he said aloud. “But\n",
      "since I am not crazy, I do not care. And the rich have radios to talk to them in their boats and to\n",
      "bring them the baseball.”\n",
      "[39] Now is no time to think of baseball, he thought. Now is the time to think of only one\n",
      "thing. That which I was born for. There might be a big one around that school, he thought. I picked\n",
      "up only a straggler from the albacore that were feeding. But they are working far out and fast.\n",
      "Everything that shows on the surface today travels very fast and to the north-east. Can that be the\n",
      "time of day? Or is it some sign of weather that I do not know?\n",
      "He could not see the green of the shore now but only the tops of the blue hills that showed\n",
      "white as though they were snow-capped and the clouds that looked like high snow mountains above\n",
      "them. The sea was very dark and the light made prisms in the water. The myriad flecks of the\n",
      "plankton were annulled now by the high sun and it was only the great deep prisms in the blue water\n",
      "that the old man saw now with his lines going straight down into the water that was a mile deep.\n",
      "The tuna, the fishermen called all the fish of that species tuna and only distinguished among\n",
      "them by their proper names when they came to sell them or to trade them for baits, were down\n",
      "again. The sun was [40] hot now and the old man felt it on the back of his neck and felt the sweat\n",
      "trickle down his back as he rowed.\n",
      "I could just drift, he thought, and sleep and put a bight of line around my toe to wake me. But\n",
      "today is eighty-five days and I should fish the day well.\n",
      "Just then, watching his lines, he saw one of the projecting green sticks dip sharply.\n",
      "“Yes,” he said. “Yes,” and shipped his oars without bumping the boat. He reached out for the\n",
      "line and held it softly between the thumb and forefinger of his right hand. He felt no strain nor\n",
      "weight and he held the line lightly. Then it came again. This time it was a tentative pull, not solid nor\n",
      "heavy, and he knew exactly what it was. One hundred fathoms down a marlin was eating the\n",
      "sardines that covered the point and the shank of the hook where the hand-forged hook projected\n",
      "from the head of the small tuna.\n",
      "Ernest Hemingway ?? The Old Man and the Sea\n",
      "11\n",
      "The old man held the line delicately, and softly, with his left hand, unleashed it from the stick.\n",
      "Now he could let it run through his fingers without the fish feeling any tension.\n",
      "This far out, he must be huge in this month, he thought. Eat them, fish. Eat them. Please eat\n",
      "them.\n",
      "[41] How fresh they are and you down there six hundred feet in that cold water in the dark.\n",
      "Make another turn in the dark and come back and eat them.\n",
      "He felt the light delicate pulling and then a harder pull when a sardine’s head must have been\n",
      "more difficult to break from the hook. Then there was nothing.\n",
      "“Come on,” the old man said aloud. “Make another turn. Just smell them. Aren’t they lovely?\n",
      "Eat them good now and then there is the tuna. Hard and cold and lovely. Don’t be shy, fish. Eat\n",
      "them.”\n",
      "He waited with the line between his thumb and his finger, watching it and the other lines at the\n",
      "same time for the fish might have swum up or down. Then came the same delicate pulling touch\n",
      "again.\n",
      "“He’ll take it,” the old man said aloud. “God help him to take it.”\n",
      "He did not take it though. He was gone and the old man felt nothing.\n",
      "“He can’t have gone,” he said. “Christ knows he can’t have gone. He’s making a turn. Maybe he\n",
      "has been hooked before and he remembers something of it.\n",
      "[42] Then he felt the gentle touch on the line and he was happy.\n",
      "“It was only his turn,” he said. “He’ll take it.”\n",
      "He was happy feeling the gentle pulling and then he felt something hard and unbelievably\n",
      "heavy. It was the weight of the fish and he let the line slip down, down, down, unrolling off the first\n",
      "of the two reserve coils. As it went down, slipping lightly through the old man’s fingers, he still\n",
      "could feel the great weight, though the pressure of his thumb and finger were almost imperceptible.\n",
      "“What a fish,” he said. “He has it sideways in his mouth now and he is moving off with it.”\n",
      "Then he will turn and swallow it, he thought. He did not say that because he knew that if you\n",
      "said a good thing it might not happen. He knew what a huge fish this was and he thought of him\n",
      "moving away in the darkness with the tuna held crosswise in his mouth. At that moment he felt him\n",
      "stop moving but the weight was still there. Then the weight increased and he gave more line. He\n",
      "tightened the pressure of his thumb and finger for a moment and the weight increased and was\n",
      "going straight down.\n",
      "[43] “He’s taken it,” he said. “Now I’ll let him eat it well.”\n",
      "He let the line slip through his fingers while he reached down with his left hand and made fast\n",
      "the free end of the two reserve coils to the loop of the two reserve coils of the next line. Now he\n",
      "was ready. He had three forty-fathom coils of line in reserve now, as well as the coil he was using.\n",
      "“Eat it a little more,” he said. “Eat it well.”\n",
      "Eat it so that the point of the hook goes into your heart and kills you, he thought. Come up\n",
      "easy and let me put the harpoon into you. All right. Are you ready? Have you been long enough at\n",
      "table?\n",
      "“Now!” he said aloud and struck hard with both hands, gained a yard of line and then struck\n",
      "again and again, swinging with each arm alternately on the cord with all the strength of his arms and\n",
      "the pivoted weight of his body.\n",
      "Nothing happened. The fish just moved away slowly and the old man could not raise him an\n",
      "inch. His line was strong and made for heavy fish and he held it against his hack until it was so taut\n",
      "that beads of water were jumping from it. Then it began to make a slow hissing sound in the water\n",
      "and he still held it, bracing [44] himself against the thwart and leaning back against the pull. The boat\n",
      "began to move slowly off toward the north-west.\n",
      "Ernest Hemingway ?? The Old Man and the Sea\n",
      "12\n",
      "The fish moved steadily and they travelled slowly on the calm water. The other baits were still\n",
      "in the water but there was nothing to be done.\n",
      "“I wish I had the boy” the old man said aloud. “I’m being towed by a fish and I’m the towing\n",
      "bitt. I could make the line fast. But then he could break it. I must hold him all I can and give him\n",
      "line when he must have it. Thank God he is travelling and not going down.”\n",
      "What I will do if he decides to go down, I don’t know. What I’ll do if he sounds and dies I\n",
      "don’t know. But I’ll do something. There are plenty of things I can do.\n",
      "He held the line against his back and watched its slant in the water and the skiff moving steadily\n",
      "to the north-west.\n",
      "This will kill him, the old man thought. He can’t do this forever. But four hours later the fish\n",
      "was still swimming steadily out to sea, towing the skiff, and the old man was still braced solidly with\n",
      "the line across his back.\n",
      "[45] “It was noon when I hooked him,” he said. “And I have never seen him.”\n",
      "He had pushed his straw hat hard down on his head before he hooked the fish and it was\n",
      "cutting his forehead. He was thirsty too and he got down on his knees and, being careful not to jerk\n",
      "on the line, moved as far into the bow as he could get and reached the water bottle with one hand.\n",
      "He opened it and drank a little. Then he rested against the bow. He rested sitting on the un-stepped\n",
      "mast and sail and tried not to think but only to endure.\n",
      "Then he looked behind him and saw that no land was visible. That makes no difference, he\n",
      "thought. I can always come in on the glow from Havana. There are two more hours before the sun\n",
      "sets and maybe he will come up before that. If he doesn’t maybe he will come up with the moon. If\n",
      "he does not do that maybe he will come up with the sunrise. I have no cramps and I feel strong. It is\n",
      "he that has the hook in his mouth. But what a fish to pull like that. He must have his mouth shut\n",
      "tight on the wire. I wish I could see him. I wish I could see him only once to know what I have\n",
      "against me.\n",
      "The fish never changed his course nor his direction [46] all that night as far as the man could\n",
      "tell from watching the stars. It was cold after the sun went down and the old man’s sweat dried cold\n",
      "on his back and his arms and his old legs. During the day he had taken the sack that covered the bait\n",
      "box and spread it in the sun to dry. After the sun went down he tied it around his neck so that it\n",
      "hung down over his back and he cautiously worked it down under the line that was across his\n",
      "shoulders now. The sack cushioned the line and he had found a way of leaning forward against the\n",
      "bow so that he was almost comfortable. The position actually was only somewhat less intolerable;\n",
      "but he thought of it as almost comfortable.\n",
      "I can do nothing with him and he can do nothing with me, he thought. Not as long as he keeps\n",
      "this up.\n",
      "Once he stood up and urinated over the side of the skiff and looked at the stars and checked his\n",
      "course. The line showed like a phosphorescent streak in the water straight out from his shoulders.\n",
      "They were moving more slowly now and the glow of Havana was not so strong, so that he knew the\n",
      "current must be carrying them to the eastward. If I lose the glare of Havana we must be going more\n",
      "to the eastward, he thought. For if the fish’s course held true I must see it for many more [47] hours.\n",
      "I wonder how the baseball came out in the grand leagues today, he thought. It would be wonderful\n",
      "to do this with a radio. Then he thought, think of it always. Think of what you are doing. You must\n",

      "Then he said aloud, “I wish I had the boy. To help me and to see this.”\n",
      "No one should be alone in their old age, he thought. But it is unavoidable. I must remember to\n",

      "“They are good,” he said. “They play and make jokes and love one another. They are our\n",

      "knows how old he is, he thought. Never have I had such a strong fish nor one who acted so\n",
      "strangely. Perhaps he is too wise to jump. He could ruin me by jumping or [48] by a wild rush. But\n",
      "perhaps he has been hooked many times before and he knows that this is how he should make his\n",
      "fight. He cannot know that it is only one man against him, nor that it is an old man. But what a great\n",

      "he pulls like a male and his fight has no panic in it. I wonder if he has any plans or if he is just as\n",
      "desperate as I am?\n",
      "He remembered the time he had hooked one of a pair of marlin. The male fish always let the\n",
      "female fish feed first and the hooked fish, the female, made a wild, panic-stricken, despairing fight\n",
      "that soon exhausted her, and all the time the male had stayed with her, crossing the line and circling\n",
      "with her on the surface. He had stayed so close that the old man was afraid he would cut the line\n",
      "with his tail which was sharp as a scythe and almost of that size and shape. When the old man had\n",
      "gaffed her and clubbed her, holding the rapier bill with its sandpaper edge and dubbing her across\n",
      "the top of her head until her colour turned to a colour almost like the backing of mirrors, and then,\n",
      "with the boy’s aid, hoisted her aboard, the male fish had stayed by the side of the boat. Then, while\n",
      "the old man was clearing the lines and preparing the harpoon, [49] the male fish jumped high into\n",
      "the air beside the boat to see where the female was and then went down deep, his lavender wings,\n",
      "that were his pectoral fins, spread wide and all his wide lavender stripes showing. He was beautiful,\n",
      "the old man remembered, and he had stayed.\n",
      "That was the saddest thing I ever saw with them, the old man thought. The boy was sad too\n",
      "and we begged her pardon and butchered her promptly.\n",
      "“I wish the boy was here,” he said aloud and settled himself against the rounded planks of the\n",

      "When once, through my treachery, it had been necessary to him to make a choice, the old man\n",

      "Aloud he said, “I wish I had the boy.”\n",
      "[51] But you haven’t got the boy, he thought. You have only yourself and you had better work\n",
      "back to the last line now, in the dark or not in the dark, and cut it away and hook up the two reserve\n",
      "coils.\n",
      "So he did it. It was difficult in the dark and once the fish made a surge that pulled him down on\n",
      "his face and made a cut below his eye. The blood ran down his cheek a little way. But it coagulated\n",
      "and dried before it reached his chin and he worked his way back to the bow and rested against the\n",
      "wood. He adjusted the sack and carefully worked the line so that it came across a new part of his\n",
      "shoulders and, holding it anchored with his shoulders, he carefully felt the pull of the fish and then\n",
      "felt with his hand the progress of the skiff through the water.\n",
      "I wonder what he made that lurch for, he thought. The wire must have slipped on the great hill\n",
      "of his back. Certainly his back cannot feel as badly as mine does. But he cannot pull this skiff\n",
      "forever, no matter how great he is. Now everything is cleared away that might make trouble and I\n",
      "have a big reserve of line; all that a man can ask.\n",
      "“Fish,” he said softly, aloud, “I’ll stay with you until I am dead.”\n",
      "[52] He’ll stay with me too, I suppose, the old man thought and he waited for it to be light. It\n",
      "was cold now in the time before daylight and he pushed against the wood to be warm. I can do it as\n",
      "long as he can, he thought. And in the first light the line extended out and down into the water. The\n",
      "boat moved steadily and when the first edge of the sun rose it was on the old man’s right shoulder.\n",
      "“He’s headed north,” the old man said. The current will have set us far to the eastward, he\n",
      "thought. I wish he would turn with the current. That would show that he was tiring.\n",
      "When the sun had risen further the old man realized that the fish was not tiring. There was only\n",
      "one favorable sign. The slant of the line showed he was swimming at a lesser depth. That did not\n",
      "necessarily mean that he would jump. But he might.\n",
      "“God let him jump,” the old man said. “I have enough line to handle him.”\n",
      "Maybe if I can increase the tension just a little it will hurt him and he will jump, he thought.\n",
      "Now that it is daylight let him jump so that he’ll fill the sacks along his backbone with air and then\n",
      "he cannot go deep to die.\n",
      "[53] He tried to increase the tension, but the line had been taut up to the very edge of the\n",
      "breaking point since he had hooked the fish and he felt the harshness as he leaned back to pull and\n",
      "knew he could put no more strain on it. I must not jerk it ever, he thought. Each jerk widens the cut\n",
      "the hook makes and then when he does jump he might throw it. Anyway I feel better with the sun\n",
      "and for once I do not have to look into it.\n",
      "There was yellow weed on the line but the old man knew that only made an added drag and he\n",
      "was pleased. It was the yellow Gulf weed that had made so much phosphorescence in the night.\n",
      "“Fish,” he said, “I love you and respect you very much. But I will kill you dead before this day\n",
      "ends.”\n",
      "Let us hope so, he thought.\n",
      "A small bird came toward the skiff from the north. He was a warbler and flying very low over\n",
      "the water. The old man could see that he was very tired.\n",
      "The bird made the stern of the boat and rested there. Then he flew around the old man’s head\n",
      "and rested on the line where he was more comfortable.\n",
      "“How old are you?” the old man asked the bird. “Is this your first trip?”\n",
      "[54] The bird looked at him when he spoke. He was too tired even to examine the line and he\n",

      "The hawks, he thought, that come out to sea to meet them. But he said nothing of this to the\n",
      "bird who could not understand him anyway and who would learn about the hawks soon enough.\n",
      "“Take a good rest, small bird,” he said. “Then go in and take your chance like any man or bird\n",
      "or fish.”\n",
      "It encouraged him to talk because his back had stiffened in the night and it hurt truly now.\n",
      "“Stay at my house if you like, bird,” he said. “I am sorry I cannot hoist the sail and take you in\n",
      "with the small breeze that is rising. But I am with a friend.”\n",
      "Just then the fish gave a sudden lurch that pulled the old man down onto the bow and would\n",
      "have pulled him overboard if he had not braced himself and given some line.\n",
      "The bird had flown up when the line jerked and the old man had not even seen him go. He felt\n",
      "the line [55] carefully with his right hand and noticed his hand was bleeding.\n",
      "“Something hurt him then,” he said aloud and pulled back on the line to see if he could turn the\n",

      "of the line.\n",
      "“You’re feeling it now, fish,” he said. “And so, God knows, am I.”\n",
      "He looked around for the bird now because he would have liked him for company. The bird\n",
      "was gone.\n",
      "You did not stay long, the man thought. But it is rougher where you are going until you make\n",
      "the shore. How did I let the fish cut me with that one quick pull he made? I must be getting very\n",
      "stupid. Or perhaps I was looking at the small bird and thinking of him. Now I will pay attention to\n",
      "my work and then I must eat the tuna so that I will not have a failure of strength.\n",
      "“I wish the boy were here and that I had some salt,” he said aloud.\n",
      "Shifting the weight of the line to his left shoulder and kneeling carefully he washed his hand in\n",
      "the ocean and held it there, submerged, for more than a [56] minute watching the blood trail away\n",
      "and the steady movement of the water against his hand as the boat moved.\n",
      "“He has slowed much,” he said.\n",
      "The old man would have liked to keep his hand in the salt water longer but he was afraid of\n",
      "another sudden lurch by the fish and he stood up and braced himself and held his hand up against\n",
      "the sun. It was only a line burn that had cut his flesh. But it was in the working part of his hand. He\n",
      "knew he would need his hands before this was over and he did not like to be cut before it started.\n",
      "“Now,” he said, when his hand had dried, “I must eat the small tuna. I can reach him with the\n",
      "gaff and eat him here in comfort.”\n",
      "He knelt down and found the tuna under the stem with the gaff and drew it toward him\n",
      "keeping it clear of the coiled lines. Holding the line with his left shoulder again, and bracing on his\n",
      "left hand and arm, he took the tuna off the gaff hook and put the gaff back in place. He put one\n",
      "knee on the fish and cut strips of dark red meat longitudinally from the back of the head to the tail.\n",
      "They were wedge-shaped strips and he cut [57] them from next to the back bone down to the edge\n",
      "of the belly. When he had cut six strips he spread them out on the wood of the bow, wiped his knife\n",
      "on his trousers, and lifted the carcass of the bonito by the tail and dropped it overboard.\n",
      "“I don’t think I can eat an entire one,” he said and drew his knife across one of the strips. He\n",
      "could feel the steady hard pull of the line and his left hand was cramped. It drew up tight on the\n",
      "heavy cord and he looked at it in disgust.\n",
      "“What kind of a hand is that,” he said. “Cramp then if you want. Make yourself into a claw. It\n",
      "will do you no good.”\n",

      "16\n",
      "Come on, he thought and looked down into the dark water at the slant of the line. Eat it now\n",
      "and it will strengthen the hand. It is not the hand’s fault and you have been many hours with the\n",
      "fish. But you can stay with him forever. Eat the bonito now.\n",
      "He picked up a piece and put it in his mouth and chewed it slowly. It was not unpleasant.\n",
      "Chew it well, he thought, and get all the juices. It would not be had to eat with a little lime or\n",
      "with lemon or with salt.\n",
      "“How do you feel, hand?” he asked the cramped [58] hand that was almost as stiff as rigor\n",
      "mortis. “I’ll eat some more for you.”\n",
      "He ate the other part of the piece that he had cut in two. He chewed it carefully and then spat\n",
      "out the skin.\n",
      "“How does it go, hand? Or is it too early to know?”\n",
      "He took another full piece and chewed it.\n",
      "“It is a strong full-blooded fish,” he thought. “I was lucky to get him instead of dolphin.\n",
      "Dolphin is too sweet. This is hardly sweet at all and all the strength is still in it.”\n",
      "There is no sense in being anything but practical though, he thought. I wish I had some salt.\n",
      "And I do not know whether the sun will rot or dry what is left, so I had better eat it all although I\n",
      "am not hungry. The fish is calm and steady. I will eat it all and then I will be ready.\n",
      "“Be patient, hand,” he said. “I do this for you.”\n",
      "I wish I could feed the fish, he thought. He is my brother. But I must kill him and keep strong\n",
      "to do it. Slowly and conscientiously he ate all of the wedge-shaped strips of fish.\n",
      "He straightened up, wiping his hand on his trousers. “Now,” he said. “You can let the cord go,\n",
      "hand, and I will handle him with the right arm alone until you [59] stop that nonsense.” He put his\n",
      "left foot on the heavy line that the left hand had held and lay back against the pull against his back.\n",
      "“God help me to have the cramp go,” he said. “Because I do not know what the fish is going to\n",
      "do.”\n",
      "But he seems calm, he thought, and following his plan. But what is his plan, he thought. And\n",
      "what is mine? Mine I must improvise to his because of his great size. If he will jump I can kill him.\n",
      "But he stays down forever. Then I will stay down with him forever.\n",
      "He rubbed the cramped hand against his trousers and tried to gentle the fingers. But it would\n",
      "not open. Maybe it will open with the sun, he thought. Maybe it will open when the strong raw tuna\n",
      "is digested. If I have to have it, I will open it, cost whatever it costs. But I do not want to open it\n",
      "now by force. Let it open by itself and come back of its own accord. After all I abused it much in\n",
      "the night when it was necessary to free and untie the various lines.\n",
      "He looked across the sea and knew how alone he was now. But he could see the prisms in the\n",
      "deep dark water and the line stretching ahead and the strange undulation of the calm. The clouds\n",
      "were building up now for the trade wind and he looked ahead and saw a [60] flight of wild ducks\n",
      "etching themselves against the sky over the water, then blurring, then etching again and he knew no\n",
      "man was ever alone on the sea.\n",
      "He thought of how some men feared being out of sight of land in a small boar and knew they\n",
      "were right in the months of sudden bad weather. But now they were in hurricane months and, when\n",
      "there are no hurricanes, the weather of hurricane months is the best of all the year.\n",
      "If there is a hurricane you always see the signs of it in the sky for days ahead, if you are at sea.\n",
      "They do not see it ashore because they do not know what to look for, he thought. The land must\n",
      "make a difference too, in the shape of the clouds. But we have no hurricane coming now.\n",
      "He looked at the sky and saw the white cumulus built like friendly piles of ice cream and high\n",
      "above were the thin feathers of the cirrus against the high September sky.\n",
      "“Light brisa,” he said. “Better weather for me than for you, fish.”\n",

      "17\n",
      "I hate a cramp, he thought. It is a treachery of one’s [61] own body. It is humiliating before\n",
      "others to have a diarrhoea from ptomaine poisoning or to vomit from it. But a cramp, he thought of\n",
      "it as a calambre, humiliates oneself especially when one is alone.\n",
      "If the boy were here he could rub it for me and loosen it down from the forearm, he thought.\n",
      "But it will loosen up.\n",
      "Then, with his right hand he felt the difference in the pull of the line before he saw the slant\n",
      "change in the water. Then, as he leaned against the line and slapped his left hand hard and fast\n",
      "against his thigh he saw the line slanting slowly upward.\n",

      "The line rose slowly and steadily and then the surface of the ocean bulged ahead of the boat and\n",
      "the fish came out. He came out unendingly and water poured from his sides. He was bright in the\n",
      "sun and his head and back were dark purple and in the sun the stripes on his sides showed wide and\n",
      "a light lavender. His sword was as long as a baseball bat and tapered like a rapier and he rose his full\n",
      "length from the water and then re-entered it, smoothly, like a diver and the old [62] man saw the\n",
      "great scythe-blade of his tail go under and the line commenced to race out.\n",
      "“He is two feet longer than the skiff,” the old man said. The line was going out fast but steadily\n",
      "and the fish was not panicked. The old man was trying with both hands to keep the line just inside\n",
      "of breaking strength. He knew that if he could not slow the fish with a steady pressure the fish could\n",
      "take out all the line and break it.\n",
      "He is a great fish and I must convince him, he thought. I must never let him learn his strength\n",
      "nor what he could do if he made his run. If I were him I would put in everything now and go until\n",
      "something broke. But, thank God, they are not as intelligent as we who kill them; although they are\n",
      "more noble and more able.\n",
      "The old man had seen many great fish. He had seen many that weighed more than a thousand\n",
      "pounds and he had caught two of that size in his life, but never alone. Now alone, and out of sight\n",
      "of land, he was fast to the biggest fish that he had ever seen and bigger than he had ever heard of,\n",
      "and his left hand was still as tight as the gripped claws of an eagle.\n",
      "[63] It will uncramp though, he thought. Surely it will uncramp to help my right hand. There are\n",
      "three things that are brothers: the fish and my two hands. It must uncramp. It is unworthy of it to be\n",
      "cramped. The fish had slowed again and was going at his usual pace.\n",
      "I wonder why he jumped, the old man thought. He jumped almost as though to show me how\n",
      "big he was. I know now, anyway, he thought. I wish I could show him what sort of man I am. But\n",
      "then he would see the cramped hand. Let him think I am more man than I am and I will be so. I\n",
      "wish I was the fish, he thought, with everything he has against only my will and my intelligence.\n",
      "He settled comfortably against the wood and took his suffering as it came and the fish swam\n",
      "steadily and the boat moved slowly through the dark water. There was a small sea rising with the\n",

      "“Bad news for you, fish,” he said and shifted the line over the sacks that covered his shoulders.\n",
      "He was comfortable but suffering, although he did not admit the suffering at all.\n",
      "“I am not religious,” he said. “But I will say ten Our [64] Fathers and ten Hail Marys that I\n",
      "should catch this fish, and I promise to make a pilgrimage to the Virgin of Cobre if I catch him.\n",
      "That is a promise.”\n",

      "I wish he’d sleep and I could sleep and dream about the lions, he thought. Why are the lions the\n",
      "main thing that is left? Don’t think, old man, he said to himself, Rest gently now against the wood\n",
      "and think of nothing. He is working. Work as little as you can.\n",
      "It was getting into the afternoon and the boat still moved slowly and steadily. But there was an\n",
      "added drag now from the easterly breeze and the old man [66] rode gently with the small sea and the\n",

      "Once in the afternoon the line started to rise again. But the fish only continued to swim at a\n",
      "slightly higher level. The sun was on the old man’s left arm and shoulder and on his back. So he\n",
      "knew the fish had turned east of north.\n",
      "Now that he had seen him once, he could picture the fish swimming in the water with his\n",
      "purple pectoral fins set wide as wings and the great erect tail slicing through the dark. I wonder how\n",
      "much he sees at that depth, the old man thought. His eye is huge and a horse, with much less eye,\n",
      "can see in the dark. Once I could see quite well in the dark. Not in the absolute dark. But almost as a\n",
      "cat sees.\n",
      "The sun and his steady movement of his fingers had uncramped his left hand now completely\n",

      "We do not have them. Can it be as painful as the spur of a fighting cock in one’s heel? I do not think\n",
      "I could endure that or the loss of the eye and of both eyes and continue to fight as the fighting cocks\n",

      "any changes. The oars are a good trick; but it has reached the time to play for safety. He is much fish\n",
      "still and I saw that the hook was in the corner of his mouth and he has kept his mouth tight shut.\n",
      "The punishment of the hook is nothing. The punishment of hunger, and that he is against\n",
      "something that he does not comprehend, is everything. Rest now, old man, and let him work until\n",
      "your next duty comes.\n",
      "He rested for what he believed to be two hours. The moon did not rise now until late and he\n",
      "had no way of judging the time. Nor was he really resting except comparatively. He was still bearing\n",

      "right foot on the fish’s head. Then he turned him over and skinned the other side and cut each side\n",
      "off from the head down to the tail.\n",
      "[78] He slid the carcass overboard and looked to see if there was any swirl in the water. But\n",
      "there was only the light of its slow descent. He turned then and placed the two flying fish inside the\n",
      "two fillets of fish and putting his knife back in its sheath, he worked his way slowly back to the bow.\n",
      "His back was bent with the weight of the line across it and he carried the fish in his right hand.\n",
      "Back in the bow he laid the two fillets of fish out on the wood with the flying fish beside them.\n",
      "After that he settled the line across his shoulders in a new place and held it again with his left hand\n",
      "resting on the gunwale. Then he leaned over the side and washed the flying fish in the water, noting\n",
      "the speed of the water against his hand. His hand was phosphorescent from skinning the fish and he\n",
      "watched the flow of the water against it. The flow was less strong and as he rubbed the side of his\n",
      "hand against the planking of the skiff, particles of phosphorus floated off and drifted slowly astern.\n",
      "“He is tiring or he is resting,” the old man said. “Now let me get through the eating of this\n",

      "Under the stars and with the night colder all the [79] time he ate half of one of the dolphin\n",
      "fillets and one of the flying fish, gutted and with its head cut off.\n",
      "“What an excellent fish dolphin is to eat cooked,” he said. “And what a miserable fish raw. I\n",
      "will never go in a boat again without salt or limes.”\n",
      "If I had brains I would have splashed water on the bow all day and drying, it would have made\n",
      "salt, he thought. But then I did not hook the dolphin until almost sunset. Still it was a lack of\n",
      "preparation. But I have chewed it all well and I am not nauseated.\n",
      "The sky was clouding over to the east and one after another the stars he knew were gone. It\n",
      "looked now as though he were moving into a great canyon of clouds and the wind had dropped.\n",
      "“There will be bad weather in three or four days,” he said. “But not tonight and not tomorrow.\n",
      "Rig now to get some sleep, old man, while the fish is calm and steady.”\n",
      "He held the line tight in his right hand and then pushed his thigh against his right hand as he\n",
      "leaned all his weight against the wood of the bow. Then he passed the line a little lower on his\n",
      "shoulders and braced his left hand on it.\n",
      "My right hand can hold it as long as it is braced, he [80] thought If it relaxes in sleep my left\n",
      "hand will wake me as the line goes out. It is hard on the right hand. But he is used to punishment\n",
      "Even if I sleep twenty minutes or a half an hour it is good. He lay forward cramping himself against\n",
      "the line with all of his body, putting all his weight onto his right band, and he was asleep.\n",
      "He did not dream of the lions but instead of a vast school of porpoises that stretched for eight\n",
      "or ten miles and it was in the time of their mating and they would leap high into the air and return\n",
      "into the same hole they had made in the water when they leaped.\n",
      "Then he dreamed that he was in the village on his bed and there was a norther and he was very\n",
      "cold and his right arm was asleep because his head had rested on it instead of a pillow.\n",
      "After that he began to dream of the long yellow beach and he saw the first of the lions come\n",
      "down onto it in the early dark and then the other lions came and he rested his chin on the wood of\n",
      "the bows where the ship lay anchored with the evening off-shore breeze and he waited to see if\n",
      "there would be more lions and he was happy.\n",
      "The moon had been up for a long time but he slept [81] on and the fish pulled on steadily and\n",
      "the boat moved into the tunnel of clouds.\n",
      "He woke with the jerk of his right fist coming up against his face and the line burning out\n",
      "through his right hand. He had no feeling of his left hand but he braked all he could with his right\n",
      "and the line rushed out. Finally his left hand found the line and he leaned back against the line and\n",
      "now it burned his back and his left hand, and his left hand was taking all the strain and cutting badly.\n",
      "He looked back at the coils of line and they were feeding smoothly. Just then the fish jumped\n",
      "Ernest Hemingway ?? The Old Man and the Sea\n",
      "23\n",
      "making a great bursting of the ocean and then a heavy fall. Then he jumped again and again and the\n",
      "boat was going fast although line was still racing out and the old man was raising the strain to\n",
      "breaking point and raising it to breaking point again and again. He had been pulled down tight onto\n",
      "the bow and his face was in the cut slice of dolphin and he could not move.\n",
      "This is what we waited for, he thought. So now let us take it. Make him pay for the line, he\n",
      "thought. Make him pay for it.\n",
      "He could not see the fish’s jumps but only heard the [82] breaking of the ocean and the heavy\n",
      "splash as he fell. The speed of the line was cutting his hands badly but he had always known this\n",
      "would happen and he tried to keep the cutting across the calloused parts and not let the line slip into\n",
      "the palm nor cut the fingers.\n",
      "If the boy was here he would wet the coils of line, he thought. Yes. If the boy were here. If the\n",
      "boy were here.\n",
      "The line went out and out and out but it was slowing now and he was making the fish earn each\n",
      "inch of it. Now he got his head up from the wood and out of the slice of fish that his cheek had\n",
      "crushed. Then he was on his knees and then he rose slowly to his feet. He was ceding line but more\n",
      "slowly all he time. He worked back to where he could feel with his foot the coils of line that he\n",
      "could not see. There was plenty of line still and now the fish had to pull the friction of all that new\n",
      "line through the water.\n",
      "Yes, he thought. And now he has jumped more than a dozen times and filled the sacks along\n",
      "his back with air and he cannot go down deep to die where I cannot bring him up. He will start\n",
      "circling soon and then I must work on him. I wonder what started him so suddenly? Could it have\n",
      "been hunger that made him desperate, [83] or was he frightened by something in the night? Maybe\n",
      "he suddenly felt fear. But he was such a calm, strong fish and he seemed so fearless and so\n",
      "confident. It is strange.\n",
      "“You better be fearless and confident yourself, old man,” he said. “You’re holding him again\n",
      "but you cannot get line. But soon he has to circle.”\n",
      "The old man held him with his left hand and his shoulders now and stooped down and scooped\n",
      "up water in his right hand to get the crushed dolphin flesh off of his face. He was afraid that it might\n",
      "nauseate him and he would vomit and lose his strength. When his face was cleaned he washed his\n",
      "right hand in the water over the side and then let it stay in the salt water while he watched the first\n",
      "light come before the sunrise. He’s headed almost east, he thought. That means he is tired and going\n",
      "with the current. Soon he will have to circle. Then our true work begins.\n",
      "After he judged that his right hand had been in the water long enough he took it out and looked\n",
      "at it.\n",
      "“It is not bad,” he said. “And pain does not matter to a man.”\n",
      "He took hold of the line carefully so that it did not fit into any of the fresh line cuts and shifted\n",
      "his weight [84] so that he could put his left hand into the sea on the other side of the skiff.\n",
      "“You did not do so badly for something worthless,” he said to his left hand. “But there was a\n",
      "moment when I could not find you.”\n",
      "Why was I not born with two good hands? he thought. Perhaps it was my fault in not training\n",
      "that one properly. But God knows he has had enough chances to learn. He did not do so badly in\n",
      "the night, though, and he has only cramped once. If he cramps again let the line cut him off.\n",
      "When he thought that he knew that he was not being clear-headed and he thought he should\n",

      "keep it for an emergency until it goes bad. But it is too late to try for strength now through\n",

      "It has more nourishment than almost any fish, he [85] thought. At least the kind of strength that\n",
      "I need. Now I have done what I can, he thought. Let him begin to circle and let the fight come.\n",
      "The sun was rising for the third time since he had put to sea when the fish started to circle.\n",
      "He could not see by the slant of the line that the fish was circling. It was too early for that. He\n",
      "just felt a faint slackening of the pressure of the line and he commenced to pull on it gently with his\n",
      "right hand. It tightened, as always, but just when he reached the point where it would break, line\n",
      "began to come in. He slipped his shoulders and head from under the line and began to pull in line\n",
      "steadily and gently. He used both of his hands in a swinging motion and tried to do the pulling as\n",
      "much as he could with his body and his legs. His old legs and shoulders pivoted with the swinging of\n",
      "the pulling.\n",
      "“It is a very big circle,” he said. “But he is circling.” Then the line would not come in any more\n",
      "and he held it until he saw the drops jumping from it in the sun. Then it started out and the old man\n",
      "knelt down and let it go grudgingly back into the dark water.\n",
      "“He is making the far part of his circle now,” he said. I must hold all I can, he thought. The\n",
      "strain will [86] shorten his circle each time. Perhaps in an hour I will see him. Now I must convince\n",
      "him and then I must kill him.\n",
      "But the fish kept on circling slowly and the old man was wet with sweat and tired deep into his\n",
      "bones two hours later. But the circles were much shorter now and from the way the line slanted he\n",
      "could tell the fish had risen steadily while he swam.\n",
      "For an hour the old man had been seeing black spots before his eyes and the sweat salted his\n",
      "eyes and salted the cut over his eye and on his forehead. He was not afraid of the black spots. They\n",
      "were normal at the tension that he was pulling on the line. Twice, though, he had felt faint and dizzy\n",
      "and that had worried him.\n",
      "“I could not fail myself and die on a fish like this,” he said. “Now that I have him coming so\n",
      "beautifully, God help me endure. I’ll say a hundred Our Fathers and a hundred Hail Marys. But I\n",
      "cannot say them now.\n",
      "Consider them said, he thought. I’ll say them later. Just then he felt a sudden banging and\n",
      "jerking on the line he held with his two hands. It was sharp and hard-feeling and heavy.\n",
      "He is hitting the wire leader with his spear, he [87] thought. That was bound to come. He had\n",
      "to do that. It may make him jump though and I would rather he stayed circling now. The jumps\n",
      "were necessary for him to take air. But after that each one can widen the opening of the hook\n",
      "wound and he can throw the hook.\n",
      "“Don’t jump, fish,” he said. “Don’t jump.”\n",
      "The fish hit the wire several times more and each time he shook his head the old man gave up a\n",

      "I must hold his pain where it is, he thought. Mine does not matter. I can control mine. But his\n",
      "pain could drive him mad.\n",
      "After a while the fish stopped beating at the wire and started circling slowly again. The old man\n",
      "was gaining line steadily now. But he felt faint again. He lifted some sea water with his left hand and\n",
      "put it on his head. Then he put more on and rubbed the back of his neck.\n",

      "home.\n",
      "“I’ll just steer south and west,” he said. “A man is never lost at sea and it is a long island.”\n",
      "It was on the third turn that he saw the fish first.\n",
      "He saw him first as a dark shadow that took so long [89] to pass under the boat that he could\n",
      "not believe its length.\n",
      "“No,” he said. “He can’t be that big.”\n",
      "But he was that big and at the end of this circle he came to the surface only thirty yards away\n",
      "and the man saw his tail out of water. It was higher than a big scythe blade and a very pale lavender\n",
      "above the dark blue water. It raked back and as the fish swam just below the surface the old man\n",
      "could see his huge bulk and the purple stripes that banded him. His dorsal fin was down and his\n",
      "huge pectorals were spread wide.\n",
      "On this circle the old man could see the fish’s eye and the two gray sucking fish that swain\n",
      "around him. Sometimes they attached themselves to him. Sometimes they darted off. Sometimes\n",
      "they would swim easily in his shadow. They were each over three feet long and when they swam fast\n",
      "they lashed their whole bodies like eels.\n",
      "The old man was sweating now but from something else besides the sun. On each calm placid\n",
      "turn the fish made he was gaining line and he was sure that in two turns more he would have a\n",
      "chance to get the harpoon in.\n",
      "[90] But I must get him close, close, close, he thought. I mustn’t try for the head. I must get the\n",

      "“Be calm and strong, old man,” he said.\n",
      "On the next circle the fish’s beck was out but he was a little too far from the boat. On the next\n",

      "gaining some more line he could have him alongside.\n",
      "He had rigged his harpoon long before and its coil of light rope was in a round basket and the\n",
      "end was made fast to the bitt in the bow.\n",
      "The fish was coming in on his circle now calm and beautiful looking and only his great tail\n",
      "moving. The old man pulled on him all that he could to bring him closer. For just a moment the fish\n",
      "turned a little on his side. Then he straightened himself and began another circle.\n",
      "“I moved him,” the old man said. “I moved him then.”\n",
      "He felt faint again now but he held on the great fish all the strain that he could. I moved him,\n",
      "he thought. Maybe this time I can get him over. Pull, hands, he thought. Hold up, legs. Last for me,\n",
      "head. Last for me. You never went. This time I’ll pull him over.\n",
      "[91] But when he put all of his effort on, starting it well out before the fish came alongside and\n",
      "pulling with all his strength, the fish pulled part way over and then righted himself and swam away.\n",

      "That way nothing is accomplished, he thought. His mouth was too dry to speak but he could\n",

      "more turns. Yes you are, he told himself. You’re good for ever.\n",
      "On the next turn, he nearly had him. But again the fish righted himself and swam slowly away.\n",

      "greater, or more beautiful, or a calmer or more noble thing than you, brother. Come on and kill me.\n",
      "I do not care who kills who.\n",
      "Now you are getting confused in the head, he thought. You must keep your head clear. Keep\n",

      "[92] Twice more it was the same on the turns.\n",
      "I do not know, the old man thought. He had been on the point of feeling himself go each time.\n",
      "I do not know. But I will try it once more.\n",
      "He tried it once more and he felt himself going when he turned the fish. The fish righted\n",
      "himself and swam off again slowly with the great tail weaving in the air.\n",
      "I’ll try it again, the old man promised, although his hands were mushy now and he could only\n",
      "see well in flashes.\n",
      "He tried it again and it was the same. So he thought, and he felt himself going before he started;\n",
      "I will try it once again.\n",
      "He took all his pain and what was left of his strength and his long gone pride and he put it\n",
      "against the fish’s agony and the fish came over onto his side and swam gently on his side, his bill\n",
      "almost touching the planking of the skiff and started to pass the boat, long, deep, wide, silver and\n",
      "barred with purple and interminable in the water.\n",
      "The old man dropped the line and put his foot on it and lifted the harpoon as high as he could\n",
      "and drove it down with all his strength, and more strength he had [93] just summoned, into the\n",

      "He felt the iron go in and he leaned on it and drove it further and then pushed all his weight after it.\n",
      "Then the fish came alive, with his death in him, and rose high out of the water showing all his\n",
      "great length and width and all his power and his beauty. He seemed to hang in the air above the old\n",

      "let it run slowly through his raw hands and, when he could see, he saw the fish was on his back with\n",
      "his silver belly up. The shaft of the harpoon was projecting at an angle from the fish’s shoulder and\n",
      "the sea was discolouring with the red of the blood from his heart. First it was dark as a shoal in the\n",
      "blue water that was more than a mile deep. Then it spread like a cloud. The fish was silvery and still\n",
      "and floated with the waves.\n",

      "touch and to feel him. He is my fortune, he thought. But that is not why I wish to feel him. I think I\n",

      "“Get to work, old man,” he said. He took a very [95] small drink of the water. “There is very\n",
      "much slave work to be done now that the fight is over.”\n",
      "He looked up at the sky and then out to his fish. He looked at the sun carefully. It is not much\n",
      "more than noon, he thought. And the trade wind is rising. The lines all mean nothing now. The boy\n",
      "and I will splice them when we are home.\n",
      "“Come on, fish,” he said. But the fish did not come.\n",
      "Instead he lay there wallowing now in the seas and the old man pulled the skiff upon to him.\n",
      "When he was even with him and had the fish’s head against the bow he could not believe his\n",

      "made a turn around his sword then passed the rope through the other gill, made another turn\n",
      "around the bill and knotted the double rope and made it fast to the bitt in the bow. He cut the rope\n",
      "then and went astern to noose the tail. The fish had turned silver from his original purple and silver,\n",
      "and the stripes showed the same pale violet colour as his tail. They were wider than a man’s hand\n",
      "with his fingers spread and the fish’s eye looked as detached as the mirrors in a periscope or as a\n",
      "saint in a procession.\n",
      "[96] “It was the only way to kill him,” the old man said. He was feeling better since the water\n",
      "and he knew he would not go away and his head was clear. He’s over fifteen hundred pounds the\n",
      "way he is, he thought. Maybe much more. If he dresses out two-thirds of that at thirty cents a\n",
      "pound?\n",
      "“I need a pencil for that,” he said. “My head is not that clear. But I think the great DiMaggio\n",
      "would be proud of me today. I had no bone spurs. But the hands and the back hurt truly.” I wonder\n",
      "what a bone spur is, he thought. Maybe we have them without knowing of it.\n",
      "He made the fish fast to bow and stern and to the middle thwart. He was so big it was like\n",
      "lashing a much bigger skiff alongside. He cut a piece of line and tied the fish’s lower jaw against his\n",
      "bill so his mouth would not open and they would sail as cleanly as possible. Then he stepped the\n",
      "mast and, with the stick that was his gaff and with his boom rigged, the patched sail drew, the boat\n",
      "began to move, and half lying in the stern he sailed south-west.\n",
      "He did not need a compass to tell him where southwest was. He only needed the feel of the\n",
      "trade wind and the drawing of the sail. I better put a small line [97] out with a spoon on it and try\n",
      "and get something to eat and drink for the moisture. But he could not find a spoon and his sardines\n",
      "were rotten. So he hooked a patch of yellow Gulf weed with the gaff as they passed and shook it so\n",
      "that the small shrimps that were in it fell onto the planking of the skiff. There were more than a\n",
      "dozen of them and they jumped and kicked like sand fleas. The old man pinched their heads off\n",
      "with his thumb and forefinger and ate them chewing up the shells and the tails. They were very tiny\n",
      "but he knew they were nourishing and they tasted good.\n",
      "The old man still had two drinks of water in the bottle and he used half of one after he had\n",
      "eaten the shrimps. The skiff was sailing well considering the handicaps and he steered with the tiller\n",

      "The shark was not an accident. He had come up from deep down in the water as the dark cloud\n",
      "of blood had settled and dispersed in the mile deep sea. He had come up so fast and absolutely\n",
      "without caution that he broke the surface of the blue water and was in the sun. Then he fell back\n",
      "into the sea and picked up the scent and started swimming on the course the skiff and the fish had\n",
      "taken.\n",
      "Sometimes he lost the scent. But he would pick it up again, or have just a trace of it, and he\n",
      "swam fast and hard on the course. He was a very big Make shark built to swim as fast as the fastest\n",
      "fish in the sea and everything about him was beautiful except his jaws. His back was as blue as a\n",
      "sword fish’s and his belly was silver and his hide was smooth and handsome. He was built as a\n",
      "sword fish except for his huge jaws which were tight shut now as he swam fast, just under the\n",
      "surface with his high dorsal fin knifing through the water without wavering. Inside the closed double\n",
      "lip of his jaws all of his eight rows of teeth were slanted inwards. They were not the ordinary\n",
      "pyramid-shaped teeth of most sharks. They were shaped like a man’s [100] fingers when they are\n",
      "crisped like claws. They were nearly as long as the fingers of the old man and they had razor-sharp\n",
      "cutting edges on both sides. This was a fish built to feed on all the fishes in the sea, that were so fast\n",
      "and strong and well armed that they had no other enemy. Now he speeded up as he smelled the\n",

      "When the old man saw him coming he knew that this was a shark that had no fear at all and\n",
      "would do exactly what he wished. He prepared the harpoon and made the rope fast while he\n",
      "watched the shark come on. The rope was short as it lacked what he had cut away to lash the fish.\n",
      "The old man’s head was clear and good now and he was full of resolution but he had little\n",
      "hope. It was too good to last, he thought. He took one look at the great fish as he watched the shark\n",

      "Ernest Hemingway ?? The Old Man and the Sea\n",
      "29\n",
      "over the water as a speedboat does. The water was white where his tail beat it and three-quarters of\n",

      "He did not like to look at the fish anymore since he had been mutilated. When the fish had\n",
      "been hit it was as though he himself were hit.\n",
      "But I killed the shark that hit my fish, he thought. And he was the biggest dentuso that I have\n",

      "great [103] DiMaggio would have liked the way I hit him in the brain? It was no great thing, he\n",
      "thought. Any man could do it. But do you think my hands were as great a handicap as the bone\n",

      "The breeze was fresh now and he sailed on well. He watched only the forward part of the fish\n",

      "It is silly not to hope, he thought. Besides I believe [104] it is a sin. Do not think about sin, he\n",

      "I have no understanding of it and I am not sure that I believe in it. Perhaps it was a sin to kill\n",

      "you can do with what there is.\n",
      "“You give me much good counsel,” he said aloud. “I’m tired of it.”\n",

      "forward.\n",
      "“God knows how much that last one took,” he said.\n",
      "[110] “But she’s much lighter now.” He did not want to think of the mutilated under-side of the\n",
      "fish. He knew that each of the jerking bumps of the shark had been meat torn away and that the fish\n",
      "now made a trail for all sharks as wide as a highway through the sea.\n",
      "He was a fish to keep a man all winter, he thought Don’t think of that. Just rest and try to get\n",
      "your hands in shape to defend what is left of him. The blood smell from my hands means nothing\n",
      "now with all that scent in the water. Besides they do not bleed much. There is nothing cut that\n",
      "means anything. The bleeding may keep the left from cramping.\n",
      "What can I think of now? he thought. Nothing. I must think of nothing and wait for the next\n",
      "ones. I wish it had really been a dream, he thought. But who knows? It might have turned out well.\n",
      "The next shark that came was a single shovelnose. He came like a pig to the trough if a pig had\n",
      "a mouth so wide that you could put your head in it. The old man let him hit the fish and then drove\n",

      "he hoped that he would see land.\n",

      "by side.\n",
      "He jammed the tiller, made the sheet fast and reached under the stem for the club. It was an oar\n",
      "handle [112] from a broken oar sawed off to about two and a half feet in length. He could only use it\n",
      "Ernest Hemingway ?? The Old Man and the Sea\n",
      "32\n",
      "effectively with one hand because of the grip of the handle and he took good hold of it with his\n",
      "right hand, flexing his hand on it, as he watched the sharks come. They were both galanos.\n",
      "I must let the first one get a good hold and hit him on the point of the nose or straight across\n",
      "the top of the head, he thought.\n",
      "The two sharks closed together and as he saw the one nearest him open his jaws and sink them\n",
      "into the silver side of the fish, he raised the club high and brought it down heavy and slamming onto\n",
      "the top of the shark’s broad head. He felt the rubbery solidity as the club came down. But he felt the\n",
      "rigidity of bone too and he struck the shark once more hard across the point of the nose as he slid\n",
      "down from the fish.\n",
      "The other shark had been in and out and now came in again with his jaws wide. The old man\n",
      "could see pieces of the meat of the fish spilling white from the corner of his jaws as he bumped the\n",
      "fish and closed his jaws. He swung at him and hit only the head and the shark looked at him and\n",
      "wrenched the meat loose. The [113] old man swung the club down on him again as he slipped away\n",
      "to swallow and hit only the heavy solid rubberiness.\n",
      "“Come on, galano,” the old man said. “Come in again.”\n",
      "The shark came in a rush and the old man hit him as he shut his jaws. He hit him solidly and\n",
      "from as high up as he could raise the club. This time he felt the bone at the base of the brain and he\n",
      "hit him again in the same place while the shark tore the meat loose sluggishly and slid down from\n",
      "the fish.\n",
      "The old man watched for him to come again but neither shark showed. Then he saw one on the\n",
      "surface swimming in circles. He did not see the fin of the other.\n",
      "I could not expect to kill them, he thought. I could have in my time. But I have hurt them both\n",
      "badly and neither one can feel very good. If I could have used a bat with two hands I could have\n",
      "killed the first one surely. Even now, he thought.\n",
      "He did not want to look at the fish. He knew that half of him had been destroyed. The sun had\n",
      "gone down while he had been in the fight with the sharks.\n",
      "“It will be dark soon,” he said. “Then I should see [114] the glow of Havana.. If I am too far to\n",
      "the eastward I will see the lights of one of the new beaches.”\n",
      "I cannot be too far out now, he thought. I hope no one has been too worried. There is only the\n",
      "boy to worry, of course. But I am sure he would have confidence. Many of the older fishermen will\n",
      "worry. Many others too, he thought. I live in a good town.\n",
      "He could not talk to the fish anymore because the fish had been ruined too badly. Then\n",
      "something came into his head.\n",
      "“Half fish,” he said. “Fish that you were. I am sorry that I went too far out. I ruined us both.\n",
      "But we have killed many sharks, you and I, and ruined many others. How many did you ever kill, old\n",
      "fish? You do not have that spear on your head for nothing.”\n",
      "He liked to think of the fish and what he could do to a shark if he were swimming free. I should\n",
      "have chopped the bill off to fight them with, he thought. But there was no hatchet and then there\n",
      "was no knife.\n",
      "But if I had, and could have lashed it to an oar butt, what a weapon. Then we might have\n",
      "fought them together. What will you do now if they come in the night? What can you do?\n",
      "“Fight them,” he said. “I’ll fight them until I die.”\n",

      "palms. They were not dead and he could bring the pain of life by simply opening and closing them.\n",
      "He leaned his back against the stern and knew he was not dead. His shoulders told him.\n",
      "I have all those prayers I promised if I caught the fish, he thought. But I am too tired to say\n",
      "them now. I better get the sack and put it over my shoulders.\n",
      "Ernest Hemingway ?? The Old Man and the Sea\n",
      "33\n",
      "He lay in the stern and steered and watched for the glow to come in the sky. I have half of him,\n",
      "he thought. Maybe I’ll have the luck to bring the forward half in. I should have some luck. No, he\n",
      "said. You violated your luck when you went too far outside.\n",
      "“Don’t be silly,” he said aloud. “And keep awake and steer. You may have much luck yet.”\n",
      "“I’d like to buy some if there’s any place they sell it,” he said.\n",
      "What could I buy it with? he asked himself. Could I buy it with a lost harpoon and a broken\n",
      "knife and two bad hands?\n",
      "“You might,” he said. “You tried to buy it with [116] eighty-four days at sea. They nearly sold it\n",
      "to you too.”\n",
      "I must not think nonsense, he thought. Luck is a thing that comes in many forms and who can\n",
      "recognize her? I would take some though in any form and pay what they asked. I wish I could see\n",
      "the glow from the lights, he thought. I wish too many things. But that is the thing I wish for now.\n",
      "He tried to settle more comfortably to steer and from his pain he knew he was not dead.\n",
      "He saw the reflected glare of the lights of the city at what must have been around ten o’clock at\n",
      "night. They were only perceptible at first as the light is in the sky before the moon rises. Then they\n",
      "were steady to see across the ocean which was rough now with the increasing breeze. He steered\n",
      "inside of the glow and he thought that now, soon, he must hit the edge of the stream.\n",
      "Now it is over, he thought. They will probably hit me again. But what can a man do against\n",
      "them in the dark without a weapon?\n",
      "He was stiff and sore now and his wounds and all of the strained parts of his body hurt with the\n",
      "cold of the night. I hope I do not have to fight again, he thought. I hope so much I do not have to\n",
      "fight again.\n",
      "[117] But by midnight he fought and this time he knew the fight was useless. They came in a\n",
      "pack and he could only see the lines in the water that their fins made and their phosphorescence as\n",
      "they threw themselves on the fish. He clubbed at heads and heard the jaws chop and the shaking of\n",
      "the skiff as they took hold below. He clubbed desperately at what he could only feel and hear and he\n",
      "felt something seize the club and it was gone.\n",
      "He jerked the tiller free from the rudder and beat and chopped with it, holding it in both hands\n",
      "and driving it down again and again. But they were up to the bow now and driving in one after the\n",
      "other and together, tearing off the pieces of meat that showed glowing below the sea as they turned\n",
      "to come once more.\n",
      "One came, finally, against the head itself and he knew that it was over. He swung the tiller\n",
      "across the shark’s head where the jaws were caught in the heaviness of the fish’s head which would\n",
      "not tear. He swung it once and twice and again. He heard the tiller break and he lunged at the shark\n",
      "with the splintered butt. He felt it go in and knowing it was sharp he drove it in again. The shark let\n",
      "go and rolled away. That was the [118] last shark of the pack that came. There was nothing more for\n",
      "them to eat.\n",
      "The old man could hardly breathe now and he felt a strange taste in his mouth. It was coppery\n",
      "and sweet and he was afraid of it for a moment. But there was not much of it.\n",
      "He spat into the ocean and said, “Eat that, galanos. And make a dream you’ve killed a man.”\n",
      "He knew he was beaten now finally and without remedy and he went back to the stern and\n",
      "found the jagged end of the tiller would fit in the slot of the rudder well enough for him to steer. He\n",
      "settled the sack around his shoulders and put the skiff on her course. He sailed lightly now and he\n",
      "had no thoughts nor any feelings of any kind. He was past everything now and he sailed the skiff to\n",
      "make his home port as well and as intelligently as he could. In the night sharks hit the carcass as\n",
      "someone might pick up crumbs from the table. The old man paid no attention to them and did not\n",
      "pay any attention to anything except steering. He only noticed how lightly and bow well the skiff\n",
      "sailed now there was no great weight beside her.\n",
      "Ernest Hemingway ?? The Old Man and the Sea\n",
      "34\n",
      "[119] She’s good, he thought. She is sound and not harmed in any way except for the tiller. That\n",
      "is easily replaced.\n",
      "He could feel he was inside the current now and he could see the lights of the beach colonies\n",
      "along the shore. He knew where he was now and it was nothing to get home.\n",
      "The wind is our friend, anyway, he thought. Then he added, sometimes. And the great sea with\n",
      "our friends and our enemies. And bed, he thought. Bed is my friend. Just bed, he thought. Bed will\n",
      "be a great thing. It is easy when you are beaten, he thought. I never knew how easy it was. And what\n",
      "beat you, he thought.\n",
      "“Nothing,” he said aloud. “I went out too far.”\n",
      "When he sailed into the little harbour the lights of the Terrace were out and he knew everyone\n",
      "was in bed. The breeze had risen steadily and was blowing strongly now. It was quiet in the harbour\n",
      "though and he sailed up onto the little patch of shingle below the rocks. There was no one to help\n",
      "him so he pulled the boat up as far as he could. Then he stepped out and made her fast to a rock.\n",
      "[120] He unstepped the mast and furled the sail and tied it. Then he shouldered the mast and\n",
      "started to climb. It was then he knew the depth of his tiredness. He stopped for a moment and\n",
      "looked back and saw in the reflection from the street light the great tail of the fish standing up well\n",
      "behind the skiff’s stern. He saw the white naked line of his backbone and the dark mass of the head\n",
      "with the projecting bill and all the nakedness between.\n",
      "He started to climb again and at the top he fell and lay for some time with the mast across his\n",
      "shoulder. He tried to get up. But it was too difficult and he sat there with the mast on his shoulder\n",
      "and looked at the road. A cat passed on the far side going about its business and the old man\n",
      "watched it. Then he just watched the road.\n",
      "Finally he put the mast down and stood up. He picked the mast up and put it on his shoulder\n",
      "and started up the road. He had to sit down five times before he reached his shack.\n",
      "Inside the shack he leaned the mast against the wall. In the dark he found a water bottle and\n",
      "took a drink. Then he lay down on the bed. He pulled the blanket [121] over his shoulders and then\n",
      "over his back and legs and he slept face down on the newspapers with his arms out straight and the\n",
      "palms of his hands up.\n",
      "He was asleep when the boy looked in the door in the morning. It was blowing so hard that the\n",
      "drifting-boats would not be going out and the boy had slept late and then come to the old man’s\n",
      "shack as he had come each morning. The boy saw that the old man was breathing and then he saw\n",
      "the old man’s hands and he started to cry. He went out very quietly to go to bring some coffee and\n",
      "all the way down the road he was crying.\n",
      "Many fishermen were around the skiff looking at what was lashed beside it and one was in the\n",
      "water, his trousers rolled up, measuring the skeleton with a length of line.\n",
      "The boy did not go down. He had been there before and one of the fishermen was looking\n",
      "after the skiff for him.\n",
      "“How is he?” one of the fishermen shouted.\n",
      "“Sleeping,” the boy called. He did not care that they saw him crying. “Let no one disturb him.”\n",
      "“He was eighteen feet from nose to tail,” the fisherman who was measuring him called.\n",
      "[122] “I believe it,” the boy said.\n",

      "[123] “Don’t sit up,” the boy said. “Drink this.”\n",
